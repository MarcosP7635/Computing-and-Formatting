One of Ge/Ay 11 c or Ge 11 d. 3.  27 units of 100-level or higher GPS courses, excluding Ge 109,  which must be approved by the appropriate option representative. HISTORY OPTION AND MINOR (H) Students who choose the history option will learn how to  do historyŠhow to think critically about past societies and their development, how  to read evidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With  the guidance of a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option  will explore the range of human experience in the realms of politics, cul -ture, religion, and economics, as well as science and technology. They  will learn both to challenge and revise existing historical narratives and  Undergraduate Information 301question their own ideas and assumptions about the past. Students will  develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources  to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback  on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students  with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical  skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to  understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside  of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work  will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers  in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a  wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent  preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or  public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history.  History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four  years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial  (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must  be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his -tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History  majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro -gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of  history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul -tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These  areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his -tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian  history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear -ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic  history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of  these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic -ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the  history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in  libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct  supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten -sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear  and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out  general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic  on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research  question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer  it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and  revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by  the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined  in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative.  These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history  proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci -ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language.  Graduation Requirements 302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech  will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history  (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore  year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also  a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or  continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social  sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con -centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a  history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of  concentration. H \n",

In the sophomore  year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also  a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or  continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social  sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con -centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a  history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of  concentration. H Option Requirements 1. H 99 abc.2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above.  Up to nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses  cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine  units of H 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these units.3. 63 of the total history units, including H 99 abc, must be in an area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the stu -dent™s adviser and the history option representative. 4. 36 of the total history units must be in an area or areas other  than the area of concentration, as defined in consultation with  the student™s adviser and the history option representative. H 99  abc may not be used to fulfill this requirement. 5. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed  as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by menu  courses.6. Three units of oral communication. En/Wr 84 satisfies this  requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other  options.7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  the courses listed above.Courses used to complete the history option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another  option or minor.  H Minor Requirements The history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen-trated study in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the history option.  History minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include  one directed reading course (H 98). All courses to be counted toward  the history minor must be taken for grades except for a freshman  humanities course in history when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students wishing to do a minor in history must declare  a minor with the history option representative. Students completing  the history minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in historyﬂ  added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross listed  Undergraduate Information 303Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for 3.  any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 725.  units required for the minor.   Students cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE  OPTION AND MINOR (HPS)The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the  opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil -osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between  science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi -mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins  and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since  antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi -cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours-es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun-dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems  in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience,  and physics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from  the faculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the  opportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis  work, and present their findings in a seminar setting. This option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of  how science is practiced and how that practice has changed over time.  Students learn to address questions such as: To what extent was the  scientific revolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and  how do scientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have  conceptions of scientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical  issues raised by experimentation with human or animal subjects? How has  relativity theory changed our conceptions of space and time? The option  is designed to complement the regular science curriculum at Caltech,  offering students the opportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the  strong technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. Because of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex  philosophical and historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in  writing and communication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS  option provides excellent preparation for students going into law, business,  medicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares stu -dents for graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science.HPS \n",

HISTORY OPTION AND MINOR (H) Students who choose the history option will learn how to  do historyŠhow to think critically about past societies and their development, how  to read evidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With  the guidance of a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option  will explore the range of human experience in the realms of politics, cul -ture, religion, and economics, as well as science and technology. They  will learn both to challenge and revise existing historical narratives and  Undergraduate Information 301question their own ideas and assumptions about the past. Students will  develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources  to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback  on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students  with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical  skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to  understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside  of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work  will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers  in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a  wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent  preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or  public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history.  History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four  years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial  (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must  be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his -tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History  majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro -gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of  history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul -tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These  areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his -tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian  history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear -ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic  history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of  these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic -ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the  history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in  libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct  supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten -sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear  and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out  general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic  on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research  question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer  it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and  revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by  the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined  in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative.  These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history  proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci -ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language.  Graduation Requirements 302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech  will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history  (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below).

HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE  OPTION AND MINOR (HPS)The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the  opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil -osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between  science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi -mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins  and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since  antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi -cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours-es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun-dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems  in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience,  and physics.

(No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be count -ed towards the HPS major.) 3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satis -fying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with  a number less than 10.4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.  Courses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. We recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option  take Hum/H/HPS 18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their  freshman humanities courses. Students making the decision to follow  this option in their sophomore year should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and  HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of Science, as early as possi -ble in that year. Students may also enter the option in their junior year  if they can complete the option™s requirements in time for graduation.  Please also note the following:Not all required courses are offered each term; students should  consult the current catalog to determine which terms required courses  are being offered, and should construct their course plan for the year  accordingly. We encourage students to choose their advanced social science  electives from among courses that will enlarge their perspective on  topics related to HPS (for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130,  PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125, PSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22).HPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two  consecutive terms in the Senior year.

HPS Minor Requirements The minor in HPS is designed for students who want to pursue con-centrated study in the field without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the HPS option. HPS minors must complete 72 units of HPS courses. Freshman  Humanities courses other than Hum/H/HPS 18 may not be counted  towards an HPS minor. Students wishing to do a minor in HPS must  declare a minor with the HPS option representative.

Students cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES (IDS) The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi -tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These  intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally  occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied  mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last  decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are  acquired with the objective of extracting actionable knowledgeŠin the  form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and pub -lic policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the  availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage,  and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans cannot deal  with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that  we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All  areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering,  manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of sce-narios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broadŠfrom sit -uations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those  in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which  computation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those  in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be  treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all  available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream.  As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and  electrical engineeringŠsignal processing, information and communica -tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo -rithmsŠbut also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The  result is an area that is new, fundamentally different that related areas  like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern  applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering.  The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and  signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of  data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary  nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses  where students will learn about how data touches science and engi -307neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu -dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry,  and beyond.  In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on  the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus  have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science.

Students will  develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources  to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback  on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students  with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical  skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to  understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside  of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work  will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers  in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a  wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent  preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or  public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history.  History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four  years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial  (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must  be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his -tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History  majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro -gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of  history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul -tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These  areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his -tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian  history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear -ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic  history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of  these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic -ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the  history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in  libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct  supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten -sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear  and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out  general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic  on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research  question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer  it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and  revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by  the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined  in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative.  These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history  proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci -ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language.  Graduation Requirements 302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech  will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history  (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore  year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also  a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or  continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social  sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con -centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a  history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of  concentration. H Option Requirements 1. H 99 abc.2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above.

H Minor Requirements The history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen-trated study in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the history option.  History minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include  one directed reading course (H 98). All courses to be counted toward  the history minor must be taken for grades except for a freshman  humanities course in history when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students wishing to do a minor in history must declare  a minor with the history option representative. Students completing  the history minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in historyﬂ  added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross listed  Undergraduate Information 303Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for 3.  any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 725.  units required for the minor.   Students cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE  OPTION AND MINOR (HPS)The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the  opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil -osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between  science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi -mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins  and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since  antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi -cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours-es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun-dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems  in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience,  and physics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from  the faculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the  opportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis  work, and present their findings in a seminar setting. This option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of  how science is practiced and how that practice has changed over time.  Students learn to address questions such as: To what extent was the  scientific revolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and  how do scientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have  conceptions of scientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical  issues raised by experimentation with human or animal subjects? How has  relativity theory changed our conceptions of space and time? The option  is designed to complement the regular science curriculum at Caltech,  offering students the opportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the  strong technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. Because of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex  philosophical and historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in  writing and communication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS  option provides excellent preparation for students going into law, business,  medicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares stu -dents for graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science.HPS Option Requirements 1. Hum/H/HPS 18; HPS 102 ab; HPS/Pl 120; and HPS 103 (one quarter). (HPS 102 b fulfills the Institute science writing require -ment.)2. One advanced course in the history of science, chosen from  HPS/H offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; one  advanced course in philosophy of science, chosen from HPS/ Graduation Requirements 304Pl offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; and any four  courses in HPS. (No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be count -ed towards the HPS major.) 3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satis -fying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with  a number less than 10.4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.  Courses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. We recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option  take Hum/H/HPS 18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their  freshman humanities courses. Students making the decision to follow  this option in their sophomore year should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and  HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of Science, as early as possi -ble in that year. Students may also enter the option in their junior year  if they can complete the option™s requirements in time for graduation.  Please also note the following:Not all required courses are offered each term; students should  consult the current catalog to determine which terms required courses  are being offered, and should construct their course plan for the year  accordingly. We encourage students to choose their advanced social science  electives from among courses that will enlarge their perspective on  topics related to HPS (for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130,  PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125, PSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22).HPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two  consecutive terms in the Senior year. Students should coordinate with  their HPS adviser in determining their course schedule.HPS Typical Course Schedule First Year It is recommended that students intending to follow the HPS  option take  Hum/H/HPS 18 as one of their freshman humanities courses.

Students should coordinate with their HPS adviser in determining their course  schedule.  HPS Minor Requirements The minor in HPS is designed for students who want to pursue con-centrated study in the field without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the HPS option. HPS minors must complete 72 units of HPS courses. Freshman  Humanities courses other than Hum/H/HPS 18 may not be counted  towards an HPS minor. Students wishing to do a minor in HPS must  declare a minor with the HPS option representative. Those completing  Graduation Requirements 306the HPS minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in History and  Philosophy of Scienceﬂ added to their transcripts.5. 72 units of HPS courses numbered 99 or above. 6. 9 units of HPS 98 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 unit required for the minor. 7. 9 units of Hum/H/HPS 18 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 units required for the minor. Students cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES (IDS) The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi -tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These  intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally  occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied  mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last  decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are  acquired with the objective of extracting actionable knowledgeŠin the  form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and pub -lic policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the  availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage,  and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans cannot deal  with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that  we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All  areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering,  manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of sce-narios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broadŠfrom sit -uations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those  in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which  computation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those  in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be  treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all  available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream.  As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and  electrical engineeringŠsignal processing, information and communica -tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo -rithmsŠbut also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The  result is an area that is new, fundamentally different that related areas  like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern  applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering.  The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and  signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of  data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary  nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses  where students will learn about how data touches science and engi -307neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu -dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry,  and beyond.  In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on  the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus  have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science. IDS Option Requirements 1.  Computer Science Fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 21 or Ma/CS 6c; and CS 38.2.  Mathematical Fundamentals.

Passing grades must be  earned in total of 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the  above requirements. IDS Double MajorsStudents interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second  option must fulfill all the requirements of the Information and Data  Sciences option. Courses may be used to simultaneously fulfill require -ments in both options. However, it is required that students have at  least 54 units of ﬂAdvanced Electivesﬂ and 18 units of ﬂApplications of Data Scienceﬂ that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a require -ment of the second option, i.e., the requirements of the Advanced  Electives and the Applications of Data Science sections must be fulfilled using courses that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling  a requirement of the second option. Any proposal to replace these  courses must be discussed with the option administrator. To enroll in  the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the  option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good aca -demic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for han-dling the heavier course load.IDS Typical Course Schedule Units per term1st2nd3rd Second Year CS 1Intro. to Computer Programming  9--CS 2Intro. to Programming Methods  -9-CS 38Algorithms --9Ma 2Differential Equations 9--Ma 3Intro. to Probability and  Statistics-9-Ma/CS 6 abIntro. to Discrete Methods 99-ACM/IDS 104Applied Linear Algebra9--HSS Electives999Scientific Fundamentals-99Other Electives--9Total 454536309Third Year SEC 10Technical Seminar Presentations -3-CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155Machine Learning & Data Mining -12-One of SEC 11-13Written Communication  --3Ma 108 aClassical Analysis9--EE/IDS 111Signal-Processing Systems and  Transforms 9--IDS/ACM/CS 157Statistical Inference --9ACM/EE/IDS 116Intro. to Probability Models 9--HSS Electives999Advanced Electives999Applications Electives-9-Other Electives--9Total 454239Fourth Year ACM/EE 106 aIntro.

INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM (ISP) The Interdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) is an undergraduate option  that allows the student to create their own scholastic requirements,  under faculty supervision, and to pursue positive educational goals that 311cannot be achieved in any of the other available options. A student™s  program may include regular Caltech courses, research courses, cours -es at other schools, and interdisciplinary study courses (item 5, next  page). In scope and depth, the program must be comparable to a nor -mal undergraduate program, but it need not include all of the specific  courses or groups of courses listed in the formulated Institute option  requirements for undergraduates.  The Curriculum Committee, a standing committee of the faculty, has  overall responsibility for the program. In addition, each student has  their own committee of at least two advisers, two of whom must be professorial faculty. Application material may be obtained at the dean  of undergraduate students™ office or website. ISP Administrative Procedures and Guidelines 1. An interested student must recruit at least two professorial faculty  members representing at least two different degree-granting options  to serve as the ISP faculty committee. Each member of the faculty  committee must provide a letter that includes:  a.  Faculty name and department/division, and the discipline    they ﬁrepresentﬂ within the proposed ISP.  b.  Faculty™s assessment of the student™s ISP proposal,     including the proposed degree title, as it relates to that     faculty™s discipline.  c.  Faculty assessment of whether the student could choose   an existing degree-granting option with some acceptable    accommodations, rather than create an ISP. That is, does    this ISP enable something that could not be accomplished   in a single option or major/minor combination.2.  Send the ISP proposal (cover sheet, proposed curriculum, and  the aforementioned letters from professorial faculty advisers to the  dean of undergraduate students for review and approval. 3.  The dean of undergraduate students sends the ISP petition to the  Curriculum Committee for review and final approval. This contract  includes the agreed-upon content of the student™s program and the  methods for ascertaining satisfactory progress for those parts of  the student™s program that are not standard Institute courses. This  contract may of course be amended, but any amendments must be  approved by the committee of two and the Curriculum Committee.  Copies of each student™s contract and of all amendments thereto,  along with all ISP records for each student and their transcript, are  kept in the permanent files of the Registrar™s Office. Passing grades  must be earned in a total of 486 units. 4.  The progress of each student in the ISP is monitored each quarter  by the registrar, and any deviations from the terms of the contract  are reported to the chair of the Curriculum Committee. Standards  for acceptable progress and for satisfactory completion of the  terms of the contract are the responsibility of the Curriculum  Committee. When the Committee is satisfied that the terms of the  contract have been fulfilled by the student, it recommends the stu -dent to the faculty for graduation.5.  A plan of study may include special ISP courses to accommodate  Graduation Requirements 312individual programs of study or special research that falls outside  ordinary course offerings. In order that credit be received for an ISP  course, a written course contract specifying the work to be accom-plished, time schedule for progress reports and completed work,  units of credit, and form of grading must be agreed upon by the  instructor, the student, and the committee of two, and submitted to  the registrar prior to initiating the work in the course. ISP courses  are recorded on the student™s transcript in the same manner as are  other Caltech courses.6. ISPs are intended for multiyear programs. Accordingly, the  Curriculum Committee urges students contemplating an ISP to  submit their petition during their second year and will not normally  consider such petitions any later than the first term of the student™s  third year. MATERIALS SCIENCE OPTION (MS) The aim of the Materials Science option is to prepare students for  research, professional practice, or advanced study in a rapidly advanc -ing interdisciplinary field, focusing on the relationships between the  properties of materials and their internal structure and how this struc -ture can be controlled. The program builds on the core curriculum to  develop analytical competence and use it for individualized research,  culminating in a one-year senior thesis. Materials Science students develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the  skills for continuing professional and intellectual growth. The first year  of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Science  degree is common for all students of the Institute, although freshman  elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of  engineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students  who elect the Materials Science option are assigned advisers appro -priate for their expressed field of interest. Together with their advisers,  they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the  Institute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities,  the Materials Science option requires one year of applied and compu -tational mathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a  wide variety of courses in science and engineering. An undergraduate  thesis is an essential part of the academic program. Any student in  the Materials Science option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to continue to work in the  Materials Science option.MS \n",

HISTORY OPTION AND MINOR (H) Students who choose the history option will learn how to  do historyŠhow to think critically about past societies and their development, how  to read evidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With  the guidance of a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option  will explore the range of human experience in the realms of politics, cul -ture, religion, and economics, as well as science and technology. They  will learn both to challenge and revise existing historical narratives and  Undergraduate Information 301question their own ideas and assumptions about the past. Students will  develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources  to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback  on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students  with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical  skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to  understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside  of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work  will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers  in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a  wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent  preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or  public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history.  History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four  years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial  (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must  be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his -tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History  majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro -gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of  history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul -tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These  areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his -tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian  history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear -ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic  history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of  these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic -ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the  history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in  libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct  supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten -sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear  and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out  general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic  on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research  question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer  it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and  revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by  the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined  in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative.  These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history  proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci -ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language.  Graduation Requirements 302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech  will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history  (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore  year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also  a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or  continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social  sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con -centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a  history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of  concentration. H Option Requirements 1. H 99 abc.2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above.  Up to nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses  cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine  units of H 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these units.3. 63 of the total history units, including H 99 abc, must be in an area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the stu -dent™s adviser and the history option representative. 4. 36 of the total history units must be in an area or areas other  than the area of concentration, as defined in consultation with  the student™s adviser and the history option representative. H 99  abc may not be used to fulfill this requirement. 5. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed  as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by menu  courses.6. Three units of oral communication. En/Wr 84 satisfies this  requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other  options.7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  the courses listed above.Courses used to complete the history option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another  option or minor.  H Minor Requirements The history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen-trated study in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the history option.  History minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include  one directed reading course (H 98). All courses to be counted toward  the history minor must be taken for grades except for a freshman  humanities course in history when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students wishing to do a minor in history must declare  a minor with the history option representative. Students completing  the history minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in historyﬂ  added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross listed  Undergraduate Information 303Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for 3.  any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 725.  units required for the minor.   Students cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE  OPTION AND MINOR (HPS)The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the  opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil -osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between  science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi -mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins  and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since  antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi -cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours-es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun-dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems  in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience,  and physics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from  the faculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the  opportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis  work, and present their findings in a seminar setting. This option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of  how science is practiced and how that practice has changed over time.  Students learn to address questions such as: To what extent was the  scientific revolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and  how do scientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have  conceptions of scientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical  issues raised by experimentation with human or animal subjects? How has  relativity theory changed our conceptions of space and time? The option  is designed to complement the regular science curriculum at Caltech,  offering students the opportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the  strong technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. Because of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex  philosophical and historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in  writing and communication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS  option provides excellent preparation for students going into law, business,  medicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares stu -dents for graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science.HPS Option Requirements 1. Hum/H/HPS 18; HPS 102 ab; HPS/Pl 120; and HPS 103 (one quarter). (HPS 102 b fulfills the Institute science writing require -ment.)2. One advanced course in the history of science, chosen from  HPS/H offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; one  advanced course in philosophy of science, chosen from HPS/ Graduation Requirements 304Pl offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; and any four  courses in HPS. (No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be count -ed towards the HPS major.) 3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satis -fying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with  a number less than 10.4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.  Courses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. We recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option  take Hum/H/HPS 18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their  freshman humanities courses. Students making the decision to follow  this option in their sophomore year should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and  HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of Science, as early as possi -ble in that year. Students may also enter the option in their junior year  if they can complete the option™s requirements in time for graduation.  Please also note the following:Not all required courses are offered each term; students should  consult the current catalog to determine which terms required courses  are being offered, and should construct their course plan for the year  accordingly. We encourage students to choose their advanced social science  electives from among courses that will enlarge their perspective on  topics related to HPS (for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130,  PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125, PSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22).HPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two  consecutive terms in the Senior year. Students should coordinate with  their HPS adviser in determining their course schedule.HPS Typical Course Schedule First Year It is recommended that students intending to follow the HPS  option take  Hum/H/HPS 18 as one of their freshman humanities courses.

Students should coordinate with their HPS adviser in determining their course  schedule.  HPS Minor Requirements The minor in HPS is designed for students who want to pursue con-centrated study in the field without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the HPS option. HPS minors must complete 72 units of HPS courses. Freshman  Humanities courses other than Hum/H/HPS 18 may not be counted  towards an HPS minor. Students wishing to do a minor in HPS must  declare a minor with the HPS option representative. Those completing  Graduation Requirements 306the HPS minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in History and  Philosophy of Scienceﬂ added to their transcripts.5. 72 units of HPS courses numbered 99 or above. 6. 9 units of HPS 98 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 unit required for the minor. 7. 9 units of Hum/H/HPS 18 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 units required for the minor. Students cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES (IDS) The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi -tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These  intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally  occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied  mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last  decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are  acquired with the objective of extracting actionable knowledgeŠin the  form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and pub -lic policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the  availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage,  and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans cannot deal  with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that  we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All  areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering,  manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of sce-narios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broadŠfrom sit -uations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those  in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which  computation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those  in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be  treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all  available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream.  As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and  electrical engineeringŠsignal processing, information and communica -tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo -rithmsŠbut also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The  result is an area that is new, fundamentally different that related areas  like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern  applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering.  The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and  signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of  data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary  nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses  where students will learn about how data touches science and engi -307neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu -dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry,  and beyond.  In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on  the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus  have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science. IDS Option Requirements 1.  Computer Science Fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 21 or Ma/CS 6c; and CS 38.2.  Mathematical Fundamentals.

Passing grades must be  earned in total of 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the  above requirements. IDS Double MajorsStudents interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second  option must fulfill all the requirements of the Information and Data  Sciences option. Courses may be used to simultaneously fulfill require -ments in both options. However, it is required that students have at  least 54 units of ﬂAdvanced Electivesﬂ and 18 units of ﬂApplications of Data Scienceﬂ that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a require -ment of the second option, i.e., the requirements of the Advanced  Electives and the Applications of Data Science sections must be fulfilled using courses that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling  a requirement of the second option. Any proposal to replace these  courses must be discussed with the option administrator. To enroll in  the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the  option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good aca -demic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for han-dling the heavier course load.IDS Typical Course Schedule Units per term1st2nd3rd Second Year CS 1Intro. to Computer Programming  9--CS 2Intro. to Programming Methods  -9-CS 38Algorithms --9Ma 2Differential Equations 9--Ma 3Intro. to Probability and  Statistics-9-Ma/CS 6 abIntro. to Discrete Methods 99-ACM/IDS 104Applied Linear Algebra9--HSS Electives999Scientific Fundamentals-99Other Electives--9Total 454536309Third Year SEC 10Technical Seminar Presentations -3-CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155Machine Learning & Data Mining -12-One of SEC 11-13Written Communication  --3Ma 108 aClassical Analysis9--EE/IDS 111Signal-Processing Systems and  Transforms 9--IDS/ACM/CS 157Statistical Inference --9ACM/EE/IDS 116Intro. to Probability Models 9--HSS Electives999Advanced Electives999Applications Electives-9-Other Electives--9Total 454239Fourth Year ACM/EE 106 aIntro.

Courses used to fulfill requirements in the ﬁApplications of Data  Scienceﬂ and ﬁAdvanced Electivesﬂ requirements cannot be used to fulfill  (i) a requirement for another major or minor; or (ii) the institute humanities  and social sciences requirements. Any replacement of these courses  must be discussed with the option administrator.   Pass/fail grading cannot be elected for courses taken to satisfy option  requirements. Courses taken as part of the data science minor are count -ed toward the total 486 units needed for Institute graduation requirements.  Typical course schedule A typical course sequence is to take CS 1 during freshman year; Ma/CS  6a, Ma 3, CS2 and CS38 during sophomore year; ACM/EE/IDS 116, ACM/ IDS 104, CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155, and IDS/ACM/CS 157 during junior  year; and EE/IDS 111 and the elective courses during senior year. INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM (ISP) The Interdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) is an undergraduate option  that allows the student to create their own scholastic requirements,  under faculty supervision, and to pursue positive educational goals that 311cannot be achieved in any of the other available options. A student™s  program may include regular Caltech courses, research courses, cours -es at other schools, and interdisciplinary study courses (item 5, next  page). In scope and depth, the program must be comparable to a nor -mal undergraduate program, but it need not include all of the specific  courses or groups of courses listed in the formulated Institute option  requirements for undergraduates.  The Curriculum Committee, a standing committee of the faculty, has  overall responsibility for the program. In addition, each student has  their own committee of at least two advisers, two of whom must be professorial faculty. Application material may be obtained at the dean  of undergraduate students™ office or website. ISP Administrative Procedures and Guidelines 1. An interested student must recruit at least two professorial faculty  members representing at least two different degree-granting options  to serve as the ISP faculty committee. Each member of the faculty  committee must provide a letter that includes:  a.  Faculty name and department/division, and the discipline    they ﬁrepresentﬂ within the proposed ISP.  b.  Faculty™s assessment of the student™s ISP proposal,     including the proposed degree title, as it relates to that     faculty™s discipline.  c.  Faculty assessment of whether the student could choose   an existing degree-granting option with some acceptable    accommodations, rather than create an ISP. That is, does    this ISP enable something that could not be accomplished   in a single option or major/minor combination.2.  Send the ISP proposal (cover sheet, proposed curriculum, and  the aforementioned letters from professorial faculty advisers to the  dean of undergraduate students for review and approval. 3.  The dean of undergraduate students sends the ISP petition to the  Curriculum Committee for review and final approval. This contract  includes the agreed-upon content of the student™s program and the  methods for ascertaining satisfactory progress for those parts of  the student™s program that are not standard Institute courses. This  contract may of course be amended, but any amendments must be  approved by the committee of two and the Curriculum Committee.  Copies of each student™s contract and of all amendments thereto,  along with all ISP records for each student and their transcript, are  kept in the permanent files of the Registrar™s Office. Passing grades  must be earned in a total of 486 units. 4.  The progress of each student in the ISP is monitored each quarter  by the registrar, and any deviations from the terms of the contract  are reported to the chair of the Curriculum Committee. Standards  for acceptable progress and for satisfactory completion of the  terms of the contract are the responsibility of the Curriculum  Committee. When the Committee is satisfied that the terms of the  contract have been fulfilled by the student, it recommends the stu -dent to the faculty for graduation.5.  A plan of study may include special ISP courses to accommodate  Graduation Requirements 312individual programs of study or special research that falls outside  ordinary course offerings. In order that credit be received for an ISP  course, a written course contract specifying the work to be accom-plished, time schedule for progress reports and completed work,  units of credit, and form of grading must be agreed upon by the  instructor, the student, and the committee of two, and submitted to  the registrar prior to initiating the work in the course. ISP courses  are recorded on the student™s transcript in the same manner as are  other Caltech courses.6. ISPs are intended for multiyear programs. Accordingly, the  Curriculum Committee urges students contemplating an ISP to  submit their petition during their second year and will not normally  consider such petitions any later than the first term of the student™s  third year. MATERIALS SCIENCE OPTION (MS) The aim of the Materials Science option is to prepare students for  research, professional practice, or advanced study in a rapidly advanc -ing interdisciplinary field, focusing on the relationships between the  properties of materials and their internal structure and how this struc -ture can be controlled. The program builds on the core curriculum to  develop analytical competence and use it for individualized research,  culminating in a one-year senior thesis. Materials Science students develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the  skills for continuing professional and intellectual growth. The first year  of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Science  degree is common for all students of the Institute, although freshman  elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of  engineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students  who elect the Materials Science option are assigned advisers appro -priate for their expressed field of interest. Together with their advisers,  they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the  Institute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities,  the Materials Science option requires one year of applied and compu -tational mathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a  wide variety of courses in science and engineering. An undergraduate  thesis is an essential part of the academic program. Any student in  the Materials Science option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to continue to work in the  Materials Science option.MS Option Requirements  1. Fulfillment of extended core requirements in Differential Equations  (Ma 2 or equivalent); Probability and Statistics (Ma 3, Ge/ ESE 118 or equivalent); Waves (Ph 2 a, Ph 12 a or equivalent),  Quantum Mechanics (Ph 2 b, Ph 12 b, Ch 21 a or equivalent);  Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Ph 2 c, Ph 12 c or  equivalent).  3132. Demonstration of competency in computer programming or com -puter science by taking CS 1, or by taking an approved alternative  course, or by passing a placement exam administered by the com -puter science option.  3. 18 units of laboratory courses taken from the following list: APh 77  bc, Ae/APh 104 bc, CE 180, CS/CNS 171, CS/CNS 174, EE 45,  EE/CS 52 ab, EE/CS 53, EE 90, EE 91, ME 50 ab, ME 72 ab, MS  121, MS/APh 122, MS 125, MS 142, or from EAS courses with the  word ﬂlaboratoryﬂ in the title, but excluding those courses for which  freshman laboratory credit is allowed.  4.

Math students go well beyond the basics to study the  structures of algebra, analysis and geometry, as well as the rudiments  of combinatorics and set theory. Students learn to write coherent and  complete proofs of various assertions, to work out non-trivial examples  and to use computational tools. The schedule of courses in the undergraduate mathematics option  is flexible. It enables students to adapt their programs to their needs  and mathematical interests and gives them the opportunity to become  familiar with creative mathematics early in their careers. Some students  go to use their background in mathematics as an entry to other fields,  such as physics, computer science, statistics, economics, business, finance, medicine and law. 315Freshmen considering majoring in mathematics should be aware  that the department strongly recommends taking the analytical  track of Ma 1 bc. Any student whose grade-point average is less than  1.9 at the end of the academic year, in the subjects under mathematics  and applied and computational mathematics may be refused permis -sion to continue work in the mathematics options.

HISTORY OPTION AND MINOR (H) Students who choose the history option will learn how to  do historyŠhow to think critically about past societies and their development, how  to read evidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With  the guidance of a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option  will explore the range of human experience in the realms of politics, cul -ture, religion, and economics, as well as science and technology. They  will learn both to challenge and revise existing historical narratives and  Undergraduate Information 301question their own ideas and assumptions about the past. Students will  develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources  to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback  on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students  with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical  skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to  understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside  of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work  will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers  in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a  wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent  preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or  public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history.  History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four  years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial  (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must  be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his -tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History  majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro -gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of  history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul -tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These  areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his -tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian  history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear -ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic  history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of  these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic -ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the  history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in  libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct  supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten -sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear  and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out  general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic  on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research  question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer  it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and  revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by  the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined  in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative.  These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history  proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci -ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language.  Graduation Requirements 302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech  will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history  (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore  year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also  a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or  continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social  sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con -centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a  history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of  concentration. H Option Requirements 1. H 99 abc.2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above.  Up to nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses  cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine  units of H 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these units.3. 63 of the total history units, including H 99 abc, must be in an area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the stu -dent™s adviser and the history option representative. 4. 36 of the total history units must be in an area or areas other  than the area of concentration, as defined in consultation with  the student™s adviser and the history option representative. H 99  abc may not be used to fulfill this requirement. 5. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed  as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by menu  courses.6. Three units of oral communication. En/Wr 84 satisfies this  requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other  options.7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  the courses listed above.Courses used to complete the history option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another  option or minor.  H Minor Requirements The history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen-trated study in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the history option.  History minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include  one directed reading course (H 98). All courses to be counted toward  the history minor must be taken for grades except for a freshman  humanities course in history when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students wishing to do a minor in history must declare  a minor with the history option representative. Students completing  the history minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in historyﬂ  added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross listed  Undergraduate Information 303Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for 3.  any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 725.  units required for the minor.   Students cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE  OPTION AND MINOR (HPS)The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the  opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil -osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between  science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi -mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins  and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since  antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi -cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours-es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun-dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems  in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience,  and physics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from  the faculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the  opportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis  work, and present their findings in a seminar setting. This option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of  how science is practiced and how that practice has changed over time.  Students learn to address questions such as: To what extent was the  scientific revolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and  how do scientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have  conceptions of scientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical  issues raised by experimentation with human or animal subjects? How has  relativity theory changed our conceptions of space and time? The option  is designed to complement the regular science curriculum at Caltech,  offering students the opportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the  strong technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. Because of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex  philosophical and historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in  writing and communication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS  option provides excellent preparation for students going into law, business,  medicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares stu -dents for graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science.HPS Option Requirements 1. Hum/H/HPS 18; HPS 102 ab; HPS/Pl 120; and HPS 103 (one quarter). (HPS 102 b fulfills the Institute science writing require -ment.)2. One advanced course in the history of science, chosen from  HPS/H offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; one  advanced course in philosophy of science, chosen from HPS/ Graduation Requirements 304Pl offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; and any four  courses in HPS. (No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be count -ed towards the HPS major.) 3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satis -fying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with  a number less than 10.4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.  Courses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. We recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option  take Hum/H/HPS 18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their  freshman humanities courses. Students making the decision to follow  this option in their sophomore year should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and  HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of Science, as early as possi -ble in that year. Students may also enter the option in their junior year  if they can complete the option™s requirements in time for graduation.  Please also note the following:Not all required courses are offered each term; students should  consult the current catalog to determine which terms required courses  are being offered, and should construct their course plan for the year  accordingly. We encourage students to choose their advanced social science  electives from among courses that will enlarge their perspective on  topics related to HPS (for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130,  PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125, PSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22).HPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two  consecutive terms in the Senior year. Students should coordinate with  their HPS adviser in determining their course schedule.HPS Typical Course Schedule First Year It is recommended that students intending to follow the HPS  option take  Hum/H/HPS 18 as one of their freshman humanities courses.

HPS Minor Requirements The minor in HPS is designed for students who want to pursue con-centrated study in the field without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the HPS option. HPS minors must complete 72 units of HPS courses. Freshman  Humanities courses other than Hum/H/HPS 18 may not be counted  towards an HPS minor. Students wishing to do a minor in HPS must  declare a minor with the HPS option representative. Those completing  Graduation Requirements 306the HPS minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in History and  Philosophy of Scienceﬂ added to their transcripts.5. 72 units of HPS courses numbered 99 or above. 6. 9 units of HPS 98 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 unit required for the minor. 7. 9 units of Hum/H/HPS 18 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 units required for the minor. Students cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES (IDS) The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi -tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These  intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally  occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied  mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last  decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are  acquired with the objective of extracting actionable knowledgeŠin the  form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and pub -lic policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the  availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage,  and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans cannot deal  with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that  we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All  areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering,  manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of sce-narios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broadŠfrom sit -uations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those  in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which  computation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those  in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be  treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all  available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream.  As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and  electrical engineeringŠsignal processing, information and communica -tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo -rithmsŠbut also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The  result is an area that is new, fundamentally different that related areas  like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern  applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering.  The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and  signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of  data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary  nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses  where students will learn about how data touches science and engi -307neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu -dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry,  and beyond.  In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on  the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus  have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science. IDS Option Requirements 1.  Computer Science Fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 21 or Ma/CS 6c; and CS 38.2.  Mathematical Fundamentals.

Passing grades must be  earned in total of 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the  above requirements. IDS Double MajorsStudents interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second  option must fulfill all the requirements of the Information and Data  Sciences option. Courses may be used to simultaneously fulfill require -ments in both options. However, it is required that students have at  least 54 units of ﬂAdvanced Electivesﬂ and 18 units of ﬂApplications of Data Scienceﬂ that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a require -ment of the second option, i.e., the requirements of the Advanced  Electives and the Applications of Data Science sections must be fulfilled using courses that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling  a requirement of the second option. Any proposal to replace these  courses must be discussed with the option administrator. To enroll in  the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the  option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good aca -demic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for han-dling the heavier course load.IDS Typical Course Schedule Units per term1st2nd3rd Second Year CS 1Intro. to Computer Programming  9--CS 2Intro. to Programming Methods  -9-CS 38Algorithms --9Ma 2Differential Equations 9--Ma 3Intro. to Probability and  Statistics-9-Ma/CS 6 abIntro. to Discrete Methods 99-ACM/IDS 104Applied Linear Algebra9--HSS Electives999Scientific Fundamentals-99Other Electives--9Total 454536309Third Year SEC 10Technical Seminar Presentations -3-CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155Machine Learning & Data Mining -12-One of SEC 11-13Written Communication  --3Ma 108 aClassical Analysis9--EE/IDS 111Signal-Processing Systems and  Transforms 9--IDS/ACM/CS 157Statistical Inference --9ACM/EE/IDS 116Intro. to Probability Models 9--HSS Electives999Advanced Electives999Applications Electives-9-Other Electives--9Total 454239Fourth Year ACM/EE 106 aIntro.

INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM (ISP) The Interdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) is an undergraduate option  that allows the student to create their own scholastic requirements,  under faculty supervision, and to pursue positive educational goals that 311cannot be achieved in any of the other available options. A student™s  program may include regular Caltech courses, research courses, cours -es at other schools, and interdisciplinary study courses (item 5, next  page). In scope and depth, the program must be comparable to a nor -mal undergraduate program, but it need not include all of the specific  courses or groups of courses listed in the formulated Institute option  requirements for undergraduates.  The Curriculum Committee, a standing committee of the faculty, has  overall responsibility for the program. In addition, each student has  their own committee of at least two advisers, two of whom must be professorial faculty. Application material may be obtained at the dean  of undergraduate students™ office or website. ISP Administrative Procedures and Guidelines 1. An interested student must recruit at least two professorial faculty  members representing at least two different degree-granting options  to serve as the ISP faculty committee. Each member of the faculty  committee must provide a letter that includes:  a.  Faculty name and department/division, and the discipline    they ﬁrepresentﬂ within the proposed ISP.  b.  Faculty™s assessment of the student™s ISP proposal,     including the proposed degree title, as it relates to that     faculty™s discipline.  c.  Faculty assessment of whether the student could choose   an existing degree-granting option with some acceptable    accommodations, rather than create an ISP. That is, does    this ISP enable something that could not be accomplished   in a single option or major/minor combination.2.  Send the ISP proposal (cover sheet, proposed curriculum, and  the aforementioned letters from professorial faculty advisers to the  dean of undergraduate students for review and approval. 3.  The dean of undergraduate students sends the ISP petition to the  Curriculum Committee for review and final approval. This contract  includes the agreed-upon content of the student™s program and the  methods for ascertaining satisfactory progress for those parts of  the student™s program that are not standard Institute courses. This  contract may of course be amended, but any amendments must be  approved by the committee of two and the Curriculum Committee.  Copies of each student™s contract and of all amendments thereto,  along with all ISP records for each student and their transcript, are  kept in the permanent files of the Registrar™s Office. Passing grades  must be earned in a total of 486 units. 4.  The progress of each student in the ISP is monitored each quarter  by the registrar, and any deviations from the terms of the contract  are reported to the chair of the Curriculum Committee. Standards  for acceptable progress and for satisfactory completion of the  terms of the contract are the responsibility of the Curriculum  Committee. When the Committee is satisfied that the terms of the  contract have been fulfilled by the student, it recommends the stu -dent to the faculty for graduation.5.  A plan of study may include special ISP courses to accommodate  Graduation Requirements 312individual programs of study or special research that falls outside  ordinary course offerings. In order that credit be received for an ISP  course, a written course contract specifying the work to be accom-plished, time schedule for progress reports and completed work,  units of credit, and form of grading must be agreed upon by the  instructor, the student, and the committee of two, and submitted to  the registrar prior to initiating the work in the course. ISP courses  are recorded on the student™s transcript in the same manner as are  other Caltech courses.6. ISPs are intended for multiyear programs. Accordingly, the  Curriculum Committee urges students contemplating an ISP to  submit their petition during their second year and will not normally  consider such petitions any later than the first term of the student™s  third year. MATERIALS SCIENCE OPTION (MS) The aim of the Materials Science option is to prepare students for  research, professional practice, or advanced study in a rapidly advanc -ing interdisciplinary field, focusing on the relationships between the  properties of materials and their internal structure and how this struc -ture can be controlled. The program builds on the core curriculum to  develop analytical competence and use it for individualized research,  culminating in a one-year senior thesis. Materials Science students develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the  skills for continuing professional and intellectual growth. The first year  of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Science  degree is common for all students of the Institute, although freshman  elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of  engineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students  who elect the Materials Science option are assigned advisers appro -priate for their expressed field of interest. Together with their advisers,  they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the  Institute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities,  the Materials Science option requires one year of applied and compu -tational mathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a  wide variety of courses in science and engineering. An undergraduate  thesis is an essential part of the academic program. Any student in  the Materials Science option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to continue to work in the  Materials Science option.MS Option Requirements  1.

Math students go well beyond the basics to study the  structures of algebra, analysis and geometry, as well as the rudiments  of combinatorics and set theory. Students learn to write coherent and  complete proofs of various assertions, to work out non-trivial examples  and to use computational tools. The schedule of courses in the undergraduate mathematics option  is flexible. It enables students to adapt their programs to their needs  and mathematical interests and gives them the opportunity to become  familiar with creative mathematics early in their careers. Some students  go to use their background in mathematics as an entry to other fields,  such as physics, computer science, statistics, economics, business, finance, medicine and law. 315Freshmen considering majoring in mathematics should be aware  that the department strongly recommends taking the analytical  track of Ma 1 bc. Any student whose grade-point average is less than  1.9 at the end of the academic year, in the subjects under mathematics  and applied and computational mathematics may be refused permis -sion to continue work in the mathematics options.

Courses in other options with high mathe -matical content may be used to fulfill this requirement with the  approval of the undergraduate option representative for mathe -matics. Of these 45 units, at most 18 can be from courses other  than Caltech Ma courses. 8. Math majors must take two quarters (18 units) of a single course, chosen from the Ma course listings with numbers between 110  and 190, inclusive. In years where one of these courses is given  as a one-term course only, it cannot be used to satisfy this  requirement. These two quarters may include courses taken to  satisfy requirements 2, 5, 6 or 7.  9. Requirements 1Œ 6 may not be taken pass/fail unless completed  during fall or winter of freshman year or when the course is only  offered as pass/fail. 10.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING OPTION (ME)The objective of the undergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering  at Caltech is to produce graduates who will attain careers and higher  education that ultimately lead to leadership roles in academia, industry,  and government in areas of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technol -ogy related to fluid, solid, thermal, and mechanical systems. The program prepares students for graduate school and profes -sional practice and inspires them to undertake careers that provide an  opportunity to address the pressing technological needs of society.  Specifically, the program builds on Caltech™s core curriculum to com -bine individual depth of experience and competence in a particular chosen mechanical engineering specialty with a strong background in  the basic and engineering sciences. It maintains a balance between classroom lectures and laboratory and design experience, and empha -sizes the problem-formulation and solving skills that are essential to  any engineering discipline. The program also strives to develop in each  student self-reliance, creativity, leadership, professional ethics, and  the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. For  317interested students, there are opportunities to conduct research with a  faculty member. The outcome of the undergraduate program is to prepare the stu -dent to build on a fundamental education in physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology and to apply those principles to the solution of  open-ended engineering problems; to design, analyze, measure, and  evaluate fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems; to work effectively as  part of a team; to communicate effectively; to apply ethical consider -ations; and to understand the broader impacts of engineering develop -ments, including societal, cultural and environmental concerns. Mechanical engineering is the branch of engineering that is generally concerned with understanding forces and motion, and their application  to solving problems of interest to society. The field includes aspects of  thermodynamics, fluid and solid mechanics, mechanisms, materials, and energy conversion and transfer, and involves the application of  physics, mathematics, chemistry, and increasingly, biology and com -puter science. Importantly, the field also emphasizes the process of  formulation, design, optimization, manufacture, and control of new sys -tems and devices.Technical developments in the last decade have established the  importance of interdisciplinary engineering and science, and as a result,  new technical disciplines within mechanical engineering have emerged.  These new areas build on an understanding of the fundamental behav -ior of physical systems; however, the focus of this work is at the inter -faces between traditional disciplines. Examples of the new disciplines include micro- and nano-mechanical systems, simulation and synthe -sis, integrated complex distributed systems, and biological engineering.Mechanical engineers can be found in many fields, including auto-motive, aerospace, materials processing and development, power pro -duction, consumer products, robotics and automation, semiconductor  processing, and instrumentation. Mechanical engineering can also be  the starting point for careers in bioengineering, environmental and aero -nautical engineering, finance, and business management.The Mechanical Engineering Option is accredited by the Engineering  Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050,  Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, (410) 347-7700. At the end of the first year, students who elect the Mechanical  Engineering Option are assigned advisers as close to their expressed  field of interest as possible, and together they develop programs of  study for the next three years. A student whose interests relate to mechanical engineering, but who  wishes to pursue a broader course of study than that allowed by the  requirements below, may elect the Engineering and Applied Science  Option.Attention is called to the fact that any student whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the required  courses listed below may be refused permission to continue work in  this option.Graduation Requirements 318ME \n",

HISTORY OPTION AND MINOR (H) Students who choose the history option will learn how to  do historyŠhow to think critically about past societies and their development, how  to read evidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With  the guidance of a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option  will explore the range of human experience in the realms of politics, cul -ture, religion, and economics, as well as science and technology. They  will learn both to challenge and revise existing historical narratives and  Undergraduate Information 301question their own ideas and assumptions about the past. Students will  develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources  to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback  on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students  with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical  skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to  understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside  of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work  will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers  in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a  wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent  preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or  public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history.  History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four  years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial  (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must  be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his -tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History  majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro -gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of  history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul -tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These  areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his -tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian  history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear -ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic  history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of  these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic -ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the  history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in  libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct  supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten -sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear  and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out  general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic  on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research  question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer  it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and  revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by  the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined  in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative.  These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history  proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci -ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language.  Graduation Requirements 302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech  will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history  (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore  year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also  a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or  continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social  sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con -centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a  history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of  concentration. H Option Requirements 1. H 99 abc.2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above.  Up to nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses  cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine  units of H 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these units.3. 63 of the total history units, including H 99 abc, must be in an area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the stu -dent™s adviser and the history option representative. 4. 36 of the total history units must be in an area or areas other  than the area of concentration, as defined in consultation with  the student™s adviser and the history option representative. H 99  abc may not be used to fulfill this requirement. 5. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed  as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by menu  courses.6. Three units of oral communication. En/Wr 84 satisfies this  requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other  options.7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  the courses listed above.Courses used to complete the history option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another  option or minor.  H Minor Requirements The history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen-trated study in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the history option.  History minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include  one directed reading course (H 98). All courses to be counted toward  the history minor must be taken for grades except for a freshman  humanities course in history when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students wishing to do a minor in history must declare  a minor with the history option representative. Students completing  the history minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in historyﬂ  added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross listed  Undergraduate Information 303Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for 3.  any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 725.  units required for the minor.   Students cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE  OPTION AND MINOR (HPS)The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the  opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil -osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between  science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi -mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins  and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since  antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi -cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours-es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun-dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems  in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience,  and physics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from  the faculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the  opportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis  work, and present their findings in a seminar setting. This option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of  how science is practiced and how that practice has changed over time.  Students learn to address questions such as: To what extent was the  scientific revolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and  how do scientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have  conceptions of scientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical  issues raised by experimentation with human or animal subjects? How has  relativity theory changed our conceptions of space and time? The option  is designed to complement the regular science curriculum at Caltech,  offering students the opportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the  strong technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. Because of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex  philosophical and historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in  writing and communication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS  option provides excellent preparation for students going into law, business,  medicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares stu -dents for graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science.HPS Option Requirements 1. Hum/H/HPS 18; HPS 102 ab; HPS/Pl 120; and HPS 103 (one quarter). (HPS 102 b fulfills the Institute science writing require -ment.)2. One advanced course in the history of science, chosen from  HPS/H offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; one  advanced course in philosophy of science, chosen from HPS/ Graduation Requirements 304Pl offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; and any four  courses in HPS. (No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be count -ed towards the HPS major.) 3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satis -fying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with  a number less than 10.4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.  Courses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. We recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option  take Hum/H/HPS 18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their  freshman humanities courses. Students making the decision to follow  this option in their sophomore year should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and  HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of Science, as early as possi -ble in that year. Students may also enter the option in their junior year  if they can complete the option™s requirements in time for graduation.  Please also note the following:Not all required courses are offered each term; students should  consult the current catalog to determine which terms required courses  are being offered, and should construct their course plan for the year  accordingly. We encourage students to choose their advanced social science  electives from among courses that will enlarge their perspective on  topics related to HPS (for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130,  PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125, PSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22).HPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two  consecutive terms in the Senior year. Students should coordinate with  their HPS adviser in determining their course schedule.HPS Typical Course Schedule First Year It is recommended that students intending to follow the HPS  option take  Hum/H/HPS 18 as one of their freshman humanities courses.

Students should coordinate with their HPS adviser in determining their course  schedule.  HPS Minor Requirements The minor in HPS is designed for students who want to pursue con-centrated study in the field without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the HPS option. HPS minors must complete 72 units of HPS courses. Freshman  Humanities courses other than Hum/H/HPS 18 may not be counted  towards an HPS minor. Students wishing to do a minor in HPS must  declare a minor with the HPS option representative. Those completing  Graduation Requirements 306the HPS minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in History and  Philosophy of Scienceﬂ added to their transcripts.5. 72 units of HPS courses numbered 99 or above. 6. 9 units of HPS 98 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 unit required for the minor. 7. 9 units of Hum/H/HPS 18 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 units required for the minor. Students cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES (IDS) The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi -tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These  intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally  occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied  mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last  decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are  acquired with the objective of extracting actionable knowledgeŠin the  form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and pub -lic policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the  availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage,  and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans cannot deal  with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that  we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All  areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering,  manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of sce-narios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broadŠfrom sit -uations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those  in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which  computation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those  in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be  treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all  available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream.  As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and  electrical engineeringŠsignal processing, information and communica -tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo -rithmsŠbut also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The  result is an area that is new, fundamentally different that related areas  like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern  applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering.  The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and  signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of  data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary  nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses  where students will learn about how data touches science and engi -307neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu -dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry,  and beyond.  In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on  the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus  have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science. IDS Option Requirements 1.  Computer Science Fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 21 or Ma/CS 6c; and CS 38.2.  Mathematical Fundamentals.

INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM (ISP) The Interdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) is an undergraduate option  that allows the student to create their own scholastic requirements,  under faculty supervision, and to pursue positive educational goals that 311cannot be achieved in any of the other available options. A student™s  program may include regular Caltech courses, research courses, cours -es at other schools, and interdisciplinary study courses (item 5, next  page). In scope and depth, the program must be comparable to a nor -mal undergraduate program, but it need not include all of the specific  courses or groups of courses listed in the formulated Institute option  requirements for undergraduates.  The Curriculum Committee, a standing committee of the faculty, has  overall responsibility for the program. In addition, each student has  their own committee of at least two advisers, two of whom must be professorial faculty. Application material may be obtained at the dean  of undergraduate students™ office or website. ISP Administrative Procedures and Guidelines 1. An interested student must recruit at least two professorial faculty  members representing at least two different degree-granting options  to serve as the ISP faculty committee. Each member of the faculty  committee must provide a letter that includes:  a.  Faculty name and department/division, and the discipline    they ﬁrepresentﬂ within the proposed ISP.  b.  Faculty™s assessment of the student™s ISP proposal,     including the proposed degree title, as it relates to that     faculty™s discipline.  c.  Faculty assessment of whether the student could choose   an existing degree-granting option with some acceptable    accommodations, rather than create an ISP. That is, does    this ISP enable something that could not be accomplished   in a single option or major/minor combination.2.  Send the ISP proposal (cover sheet, proposed curriculum, and  the aforementioned letters from professorial faculty advisers to the  dean of undergraduate students for review and approval. 3.  The dean of undergraduate students sends the ISP petition to the  Curriculum Committee for review and final approval. This contract  includes the agreed-upon content of the student™s program and the  methods for ascertaining satisfactory progress for those parts of  the student™s program that are not standard Institute courses. This  contract may of course be amended, but any amendments must be  approved by the committee of two and the Curriculum Committee.  Copies of each student™s contract and of all amendments thereto,  along with all ISP records for each student and their transcript, are  kept in the permanent files of the Registrar™s Office. Passing grades  must be earned in a total of 486 units. 4.  The progress of each student in the ISP is monitored each quarter  by the registrar, and any deviations from the terms of the contract  are reported to the chair of the Curriculum Committee. Standards  for acceptable progress and for satisfactory completion of the  terms of the contract are the responsibility of the Curriculum  Committee. When the Committee is satisfied that the terms of the  contract have been fulfilled by the student, it recommends the stu -dent to the faculty for graduation.5.  A plan of study may include special ISP courses to accommodate  Graduation Requirements 312individual programs of study or special research that falls outside  ordinary course offerings. In order that credit be received for an ISP  course, a written course contract specifying the work to be accom-plished, time schedule for progress reports and completed work,  units of credit, and form of grading must be agreed upon by the  instructor, the student, and the committee of two, and submitted to  the registrar prior to initiating the work in the course. ISP courses  are recorded on the student™s transcript in the same manner as are  other Caltech courses.6. ISPs are intended for multiyear programs. Accordingly, the  Curriculum Committee urges students contemplating an ISP to  submit their petition during their second year and will not normally  consider such petitions any later than the first term of the student™s  third year. MATERIALS SCIENCE OPTION (MS) The aim of the Materials Science option is to prepare students for  research, professional practice, or advanced study in a rapidly advanc -ing interdisciplinary field, focusing on the relationships between the  properties of materials and their internal structure and how this struc -ture can be controlled. The program builds on the core curriculum to  develop analytical competence and use it for individualized research,  culminating in a one-year senior thesis. Materials Science students develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the  skills for continuing professional and intellectual growth. The first year  of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Science  degree is common for all students of the Institute, although freshman  elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of  engineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students  who elect the Materials Science option are assigned advisers appro -priate for their expressed field of interest. Together with their advisers,  they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the  Institute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities,  the Materials Science option requires one year of applied and compu -tational mathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a  wide variety of courses in science and engineering. An undergraduate  thesis is an essential part of the academic program. Any student in  the Materials Science option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to continue to work in the  Materials Science option.MS Option Requirements  1. Fulfillment of extended core requirements in Differential Equations  (Ma 2 or equivalent); Probability and Statistics (Ma 3, Ge/ ESE 118 or equivalent); Waves (Ph 2 a, Ph 12 a or equivalent),  Quantum Mechanics (Ph 2 b, Ph 12 b, Ch 21 a or equivalent);  Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Ph 2 c, Ph 12 c or  equivalent).  3132.

Math students go well beyond the basics to study the  structures of algebra, analysis and geometry, as well as the rudiments  of combinatorics and set theory. Students learn to write coherent and  complete proofs of various assertions, to work out non-trivial examples  and to use computational tools. The schedule of courses in the undergraduate mathematics option  is flexible. It enables students to adapt their programs to their needs  and mathematical interests and gives them the opportunity to become  familiar with creative mathematics early in their careers. Some students  go to use their background in mathematics as an entry to other fields,  such as physics, computer science, statistics, economics, business, finance, medicine and law. 315Freshmen considering majoring in mathematics should be aware  that the department strongly recommends taking the analytical  track of Ma 1 bc. Any student whose grade-point average is less than  1.9 at the end of the academic year, in the subjects under mathematics  and applied and computational mathematics may be refused permis -sion to continue work in the mathematics options.

Courses in other options with high mathe -matical content may be used to fulfill this requirement with the  approval of the undergraduate option representative for mathe -matics. Of these 45 units, at most 18 can be from courses other  than Caltech Ma courses. 8. Math majors must take two quarters (18 units) of a single course, chosen from the Ma course listings with numbers between 110  and 190, inclusive. In years where one of these courses is given  as a one-term course only, it cannot be used to satisfy this  requirement. These two quarters may include courses taken to  satisfy requirements 2, 5, 6 or 7.  9. Requirements 1Œ 6 may not be taken pass/fail unless completed  during fall or winter of freshman year or when the course is only  offered as pass/fail. 10.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING OPTION (ME)The objective of the undergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering  at Caltech is to produce graduates who will attain careers and higher  education that ultimately lead to leadership roles in academia, industry,  and government in areas of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technol -ogy related to fluid, solid, thermal, and mechanical systems. The program prepares students for graduate school and profes -sional practice and inspires them to undertake careers that provide an  opportunity to address the pressing technological needs of society.  Specifically, the program builds on Caltech™s core curriculum to com -bine individual depth of experience and competence in a particular chosen mechanical engineering specialty with a strong background in  the basic and engineering sciences. It maintains a balance between classroom lectures and laboratory and design experience, and empha -sizes the problem-formulation and solving skills that are essential to  any engineering discipline. The program also strives to develop in each  student self-reliance, creativity, leadership, professional ethics, and  the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. For  317interested students, there are opportunities to conduct research with a  faculty member. The outcome of the undergraduate program is to prepare the stu -dent to build on a fundamental education in physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology and to apply those principles to the solution of  open-ended engineering problems; to design, analyze, measure, and  evaluate fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems; to work effectively as  part of a team; to communicate effectively; to apply ethical consider -ations; and to understand the broader impacts of engineering develop -ments, including societal, cultural and environmental concerns. Mechanical engineering is the branch of engineering that is generally concerned with understanding forces and motion, and their application  to solving problems of interest to society. The field includes aspects of  thermodynamics, fluid and solid mechanics, mechanisms, materials, and energy conversion and transfer, and involves the application of  physics, mathematics, chemistry, and increasingly, biology and com -puter science. Importantly, the field also emphasizes the process of  formulation, design, optimization, manufacture, and control of new sys -tems and devices.Technical developments in the last decade have established the  importance of interdisciplinary engineering and science, and as a result,  new technical disciplines within mechanical engineering have emerged.  These new areas build on an understanding of the fundamental behav -ior of physical systems; however, the focus of this work is at the inter -faces between traditional disciplines. Examples of the new disciplines include micro- and nano-mechanical systems, simulation and synthe -sis, integrated complex distributed systems, and biological engineering.Mechanical engineers can be found in many fields, including auto-motive, aerospace, materials processing and development, power pro -duction, consumer products, robotics and automation, semiconductor  processing, and instrumentation. Mechanical engineering can also be  the starting point for careers in bioengineering, environmental and aero -nautical engineering, finance, and business management.The Mechanical Engineering Option is accredited by the Engineering  Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050,  Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, (410) 347-7700. At the end of the first year, students who elect the Mechanical  Engineering Option are assigned advisers as close to their expressed  field of interest as possible, and together they develop programs of  study for the next three years. A student whose interests relate to mechanical engineering, but who  wishes to pursue a broader course of study than that allowed by the  requirements below, may elect the Engineering and Applied Science  Option.Attention is called to the fact that any student whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the required  courses listed below may be refused permission to continue work in  this option.Graduation Requirements 318ME Option Requirements 1.

The student™s transcript will include the phrase ﬁminor in  Neurobiologyﬂ. A Neurobiology minor is not available to majors in the  CNS or Biology options.NB Minor Requirements 1. Biology fundamentals. Bi 8 and Bi 92. Intermediate biology: Genetics: Bi 122; Development: Bi 117;  plus nine units of other 100-level Bi, NB, or Ch courses3. Introduction to neuroscience: NB/Bi/CNS 150 4. Advanced neurobiology: 18 additional units of 100- or 200-  level NB electives, that are not applied to the above require -ments and are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a require -ment of the student™s major option, approved by their assigned  biology advisor or the option representative.   PHILOSOPHY OPTION AND MINOR (PI)The philosophy option provides students with a broad education in  philosophy that is designed to complement the scientific curriculum at Caltech. Philosophy majors will be expected to learn about some of the  major figures and movements in the history of philosophy, and to learn  about contemporary philosophical debates. The philosophy option also aims to provide students with new perspectives on the material they  learn in their science courses, and to enable them to bring their techni -cal skills and scientific learning to traditional problems in philosophy.  Graduation Requirements 320The philosophy curriculum will help students to acquire the basic tools  of philosophical analysis: the ability to read and interpret philosophical  texts; the ability to identify strengths and weaknesses of philosophical  arguments; the ability to develop well-reasoned defenses of philosophi -cal positions; and the ability to anticipate objections to one™s own views.  In addition, the philosophy option will train students to express them -selves clearly and concisely in both writing and speaking. These critical  thinking and communication skills provide an excellent foundation for  any intellectual endeavor, and are critical to those pursuing careers in  fields such as law, business, medicine, and scientific research. The courses in the philosophy option concentrate in four major areas: philosophy of science; philosophy of mind, brain, and behavior;  history of philosophy; and ethics. In their coursework, students will  have the opportunity to discuss and debate philosophical issues in  small groups, and will learn how to offer and receive constructive  criticism. They will also receive detailed feedback on their persua -sive writing from several different members of the philosophy faculty.  In their senior thesis, philosophy majors will have the opportunity to pursue more intensive research in one particular area of philosophy,  and to sustain an argument on a larger scale, while working one-on- one with a member of the philosophy faculty. This will provide inter -ested students with a solid foundation for graduate work in philosophy and related fields.  Philosophy majors must take at least 99 units of philosophy courses during their four years as undergraduates. These must include 18 units  of Pl 90 ab, to be taken in any two consecutive terms in the senior year.  The 99 units may include nine units of freshman humanities in philoso -phy (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below), nine units of  Pl 98, and up to 18 units of study in related disciplines. Depending on their interests, philosophy majors may be required by the  option representative or their advisers to take up to 18 units in one or more  related areas. For example, students writing on political philosophy or phi -losophy of neuroscience will be expected to have the appropriate political  science or neuroscience background. Students whose primary interest  lies in the philosophy of scienceŠparticularly in the philosophy of specific  sciences such as physics or biologyŠwill have their intellectual interests  best served by taking classes in both the history and philosophy of sci-ence. Such students are encouraged to pursue the HPS option; or, if they  choose the philosophy option, they may be required to take some history  of science courses as part of their 99-unit requirement. Students considering the philosophy option will be well advised to take  a freshman humanities course in philosophy. From the sophomore year  onward, they should plan on taking one philosophy course per term, cul -minating in two terms of Pl 90 ab in the senior year. Students in Pl 90 ab  work with a faculty adviser to write a 10,000- to 12,000-word paper on a  topic of mutual interest. Senior theses are expected to be of a high stan -dard and to form the basis of students™ applications to graduate study in  philosophy, should they so desire. With the exception of Pl 98 and courses  taken during the first two quarters of the freshman year, all courses to be  counted toward the philosophy option must be taken for grades unless  special permission is granted by the option representative. 321PI \n",

HISTORY OPTION AND MINOR (H) Students who choose the history option will learn how to  do historyŠhow to think critically about past societies and their development, how  to read evidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With  the guidance of a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option  will explore the range of human experience in the realms of politics, cul -ture, religion, and economics, as well as science and technology. They  will learn both to challenge and revise existing historical narratives and  Undergraduate Information 301question their own ideas and assumptions about the past. Students will  develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources  to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback  on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students  with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical  skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to  understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside  of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work  will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers  in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a  wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent  preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or  public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history.  History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four  years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial  (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must  be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his -tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History  majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro -gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of  history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul -tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These  areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his -tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian  history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear -ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic  history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of  these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic -ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the  history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in  libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct  supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten -sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear  and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out  general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic  on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research  question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer  it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and  revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by  the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined  in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative.  These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history  proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci -ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language.  Graduation Requirements 302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech  will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history  (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore  year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also  a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or  continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social  sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con -centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a  history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of  concentration. H Option Requirements 1. H 99 abc.2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above.  Up to nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses  cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine  units of H 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these units.3. 63 of the total history units, including H 99 abc, must be in an area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the stu -dent™s adviser and the history option representative. 4. 36 of the total history units must be in an area or areas other  than the area of concentration, as defined in consultation with  the student™s adviser and the history option representative. H 99  abc may not be used to fulfill this requirement. 5. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed  as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by menu  courses.6. Three units of oral communication. En/Wr 84 satisfies this  requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other  options.7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  the courses listed above.Courses used to complete the history option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another  option or minor.  H Minor Requirements The history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen-trated study in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the history option.  History minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include  one directed reading course (H 98). All courses to be counted toward  the history minor must be taken for grades except for a freshman  humanities course in history when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students wishing to do a minor in history must declare  a minor with the history option representative. Students completing  the history minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in historyﬂ  added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross listed  Undergraduate Information 303Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for 3.  any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 725.  units required for the minor.   Students cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE  OPTION AND MINOR (HPS)The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the  opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil -osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between  science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi -mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins  and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since  antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi -cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours-es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun-dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems  in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience,  and physics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from  the faculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the  opportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis  work, and present their findings in a seminar setting. This option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of  how science is practiced and how that practice has changed over time.  Students learn to address questions such as: To what extent was the  scientific revolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and  how do scientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have  conceptions of scientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical  issues raised by experimentation with human or animal subjects? How has  relativity theory changed our conceptions of space and time? The option  is designed to complement the regular science curriculum at Caltech,  offering students the opportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the  strong technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. Because of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex  philosophical and historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in  writing and communication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS  option provides excellent preparation for students going into law, business,  medicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares stu -dents for graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science.HPS Option Requirements 1. Hum/H/HPS 18; HPS 102 ab; HPS/Pl 120; and HPS 103 (one quarter). (HPS 102 b fulfills the Institute science writing require -ment.)2. One advanced course in the history of science, chosen from  HPS/H offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; one  advanced course in philosophy of science, chosen from HPS/ Graduation Requirements 304Pl offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; and any four  courses in HPS. (No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be count -ed towards the HPS major.) 3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satis -fying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with  a number less than 10.4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.  Courses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. We recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option  take Hum/H/HPS 18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their  freshman humanities courses. Students making the decision to follow  this option in their sophomore year should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and  HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of Science, as early as possi -ble in that year. Students may also enter the option in their junior year  if they can complete the option™s requirements in time for graduation.  Please also note the following:Not all required courses are offered each term; students should  consult the current catalog to determine which terms required courses  are being offered, and should construct their course plan for the year  accordingly. We encourage students to choose their advanced social science  electives from among courses that will enlarge their perspective on  topics related to HPS (for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130,  PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125, PSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22).HPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two  consecutive terms in the Senior year. Students should coordinate with  their HPS adviser in determining their course schedule.HPS Typical Course Schedule First Year It is recommended that students intending to follow the HPS  option take  Hum/H/HPS 18 as one of their freshman humanities courses.

HPS Minor Requirements The minor in HPS is designed for students who want to pursue con-centrated study in the field without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the HPS option. HPS minors must complete 72 units of HPS courses. Freshman  Humanities courses other than Hum/H/HPS 18 may not be counted  towards an HPS minor. Students wishing to do a minor in HPS must  declare a minor with the HPS option representative. Those completing  Graduation Requirements 306the HPS minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in History and  Philosophy of Scienceﬂ added to their transcripts.5. 72 units of HPS courses numbered 99 or above. 6. 9 units of HPS 98 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 unit required for the minor. 7. 9 units of Hum/H/HPS 18 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 units required for the minor. Students cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES (IDS) The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi -tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These  intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally  occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied  mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last  decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are  acquired with the objective of extracting actionable knowledgeŠin the  form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and pub -lic policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the  availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage,  and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans cannot deal  with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that  we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All  areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering,  manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of sce-narios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broadŠfrom sit -uations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those  in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which  computation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those  in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be  treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all  available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream.  As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and  electrical engineeringŠsignal processing, information and communica -tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo -rithmsŠbut also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The  result is an area that is new, fundamentally different that related areas  like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern  applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering.  The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and  signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of  data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary  nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses  where students will learn about how data touches science and engi -307neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu -dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry,  and beyond.  In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on  the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus  have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science. IDS Option Requirements 1.  Computer Science Fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 21 or Ma/CS 6c; and CS 38.2.  Mathematical Fundamentals.

Passing grades must be  earned in total of 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the  above requirements. IDS Double MajorsStudents interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second  option must fulfill all the requirements of the Information and Data  Sciences option. Courses may be used to simultaneously fulfill require -ments in both options. However, it is required that students have at  least 54 units of ﬂAdvanced Electivesﬂ and 18 units of ﬂApplications of Data Scienceﬂ that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a require -ment of the second option, i.e., the requirements of the Advanced  Electives and the Applications of Data Science sections must be fulfilled using courses that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling  a requirement of the second option. Any proposal to replace these  courses must be discussed with the option administrator. To enroll in  the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the  option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good aca -demic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for han-dling the heavier course load.IDS Typical Course Schedule Units per term1st2nd3rd Second Year CS 1Intro. to Computer Programming  9--CS 2Intro. to Programming Methods  -9-CS 38Algorithms --9Ma 2Differential Equations 9--Ma 3Intro. to Probability and  Statistics-9-Ma/CS 6 abIntro. to Discrete Methods 99-ACM/IDS 104Applied Linear Algebra9--HSS Electives999Scientific Fundamentals-99Other Electives--9Total 454536309Third Year SEC 10Technical Seminar Presentations -3-CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155Machine Learning & Data Mining -12-One of SEC 11-13Written Communication  --3Ma 108 aClassical Analysis9--EE/IDS 111Signal-Processing Systems and  Transforms 9--IDS/ACM/CS 157Statistical Inference --9ACM/EE/IDS 116Intro. to Probability Models 9--HSS Electives999Advanced Electives999Applications Electives-9-Other Electives--9Total 454239Fourth Year ACM/EE 106 aIntro.

INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM (ISP) The Interdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) is an undergraduate option  that allows the student to create their own scholastic requirements,  under faculty supervision, and to pursue positive educational goals that 311cannot be achieved in any of the other available options. A student™s  program may include regular Caltech courses, research courses, cours -es at other schools, and interdisciplinary study courses (item 5, next  page). In scope and depth, the program must be comparable to a nor -mal undergraduate program, but it need not include all of the specific  courses or groups of courses listed in the formulated Institute option  requirements for undergraduates.  The Curriculum Committee, a standing committee of the faculty, has  overall responsibility for the program. In addition, each student has  their own committee of at least two advisers, two of whom must be professorial faculty. Application material may be obtained at the dean  of undergraduate students™ office or website. ISP Administrative Procedures and Guidelines 1. An interested student must recruit at least two professorial faculty  members representing at least two different degree-granting options  to serve as the ISP faculty committee. Each member of the faculty  committee must provide a letter that includes:  a.  Faculty name and department/division, and the discipline    they ﬁrepresentﬂ within the proposed ISP.  b.  Faculty™s assessment of the student™s ISP proposal,     including the proposed degree title, as it relates to that     faculty™s discipline.  c.  Faculty assessment of whether the student could choose   an existing degree-granting option with some acceptable    accommodations, rather than create an ISP. That is, does    this ISP enable something that could not be accomplished   in a single option or major/minor combination.2.  Send the ISP proposal (cover sheet, proposed curriculum, and  the aforementioned letters from professorial faculty advisers to the  dean of undergraduate students for review and approval. 3.  The dean of undergraduate students sends the ISP petition to the  Curriculum Committee for review and final approval. This contract  includes the agreed-upon content of the student™s program and the  methods for ascertaining satisfactory progress for those parts of  the student™s program that are not standard Institute courses. This  contract may of course be amended, but any amendments must be  approved by the committee of two and the Curriculum Committee.  Copies of each student™s contract and of all amendments thereto,  along with all ISP records for each student and their transcript, are  kept in the permanent files of the Registrar™s Office. Passing grades  must be earned in a total of 486 units. 4.  The progress of each student in the ISP is monitored each quarter  by the registrar, and any deviations from the terms of the contract  are reported to the chair of the Curriculum Committee. Standards  for acceptable progress and for satisfactory completion of the  terms of the contract are the responsibility of the Curriculum  Committee. When the Committee is satisfied that the terms of the  contract have been fulfilled by the student, it recommends the stu -dent to the faculty for graduation.5.  A plan of study may include special ISP courses to accommodate  Graduation Requirements 312individual programs of study or special research that falls outside  ordinary course offerings. In order that credit be received for an ISP  course, a written course contract specifying the work to be accom-plished, time schedule for progress reports and completed work,  units of credit, and form of grading must be agreed upon by the  instructor, the student, and the committee of two, and submitted to  the registrar prior to initiating the work in the course. ISP courses  are recorded on the student™s transcript in the same manner as are  other Caltech courses.6. ISPs are intended for multiyear programs. Accordingly, the  Curriculum Committee urges students contemplating an ISP to  submit their petition during their second year and will not normally  consider such petitions any later than the first term of the student™s  third year. MATERIALS SCIENCE OPTION (MS) The aim of the Materials Science option is to prepare students for  research, professional practice, or advanced study in a rapidly advanc -ing interdisciplinary field, focusing on the relationships between the  properties of materials and their internal structure and how this struc -ture can be controlled. The program builds on the core curriculum to  develop analytical competence and use it for individualized research,  culminating in a one-year senior thesis. Materials Science students develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the  skills for continuing professional and intellectual growth. The first year  of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Science  degree is common for all students of the Institute, although freshman  elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of  engineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students  who elect the Materials Science option are assigned advisers appro -priate for their expressed field of interest. Together with their advisers,  they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the  Institute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities,  the Materials Science option requires one year of applied and compu -tational mathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a  wide variety of courses in science and engineering. An undergraduate  thesis is an essential part of the academic program. Any student in  the Materials Science option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to continue to work in the  Materials Science option.MS Option Requirements  1.

Math students go well beyond the basics to study the  structures of algebra, analysis and geometry, as well as the rudiments  of combinatorics and set theory. Students learn to write coherent and  complete proofs of various assertions, to work out non-trivial examples  and to use computational tools. The schedule of courses in the undergraduate mathematics option  is flexible. It enables students to adapt their programs to their needs  and mathematical interests and gives them the opportunity to become  familiar with creative mathematics early in their careers. Some students  go to use their background in mathematics as an entry to other fields,  such as physics, computer science, statistics, economics, business, finance, medicine and law. 315Freshmen considering majoring in mathematics should be aware  that the department strongly recommends taking the analytical  track of Ma 1 bc. Any student whose grade-point average is less than  1.9 at the end of the academic year, in the subjects under mathematics  and applied and computational mathematics may be refused permis -sion to continue work in the mathematics options.

Courses in other options with high mathe -matical content may be used to fulfill this requirement with the  approval of the undergraduate option representative for mathe -matics. Of these 45 units, at most 18 can be from courses other  than Caltech Ma courses. 8. Math majors must take two quarters (18 units) of a single course, chosen from the Ma course listings with numbers between 110  and 190, inclusive. In years where one of these courses is given  as a one-term course only, it cannot be used to satisfy this  requirement. These two quarters may include courses taken to  satisfy requirements 2, 5, 6 or 7.  9. Requirements 1Œ 6 may not be taken pass/fail unless completed  during fall or winter of freshman year or when the course is only  offered as pass/fail. 10.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING OPTION (ME)The objective of the undergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering  at Caltech is to produce graduates who will attain careers and higher  education that ultimately lead to leadership roles in academia, industry,  and government in areas of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technol -ogy related to fluid, solid, thermal, and mechanical systems. The program prepares students for graduate school and profes -sional practice and inspires them to undertake careers that provide an  opportunity to address the pressing technological needs of society.  Specifically, the program builds on Caltech™s core curriculum to com -bine individual depth of experience and competence in a particular chosen mechanical engineering specialty with a strong background in  the basic and engineering sciences. It maintains a balance between classroom lectures and laboratory and design experience, and empha -sizes the problem-formulation and solving skills that are essential to  any engineering discipline. The program also strives to develop in each  student self-reliance, creativity, leadership, professional ethics, and  the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. For  317interested students, there are opportunities to conduct research with a  faculty member. The outcome of the undergraduate program is to prepare the stu -dent to build on a fundamental education in physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology and to apply those principles to the solution of  open-ended engineering problems; to design, analyze, measure, and  evaluate fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems; to work effectively as  part of a team; to communicate effectively; to apply ethical consider -ations; and to understand the broader impacts of engineering develop -ments, including societal, cultural and environmental concerns. Mechanical engineering is the branch of engineering that is generally concerned with understanding forces and motion, and their application  to solving problems of interest to society. The field includes aspects of  thermodynamics, fluid and solid mechanics, mechanisms, materials, and energy conversion and transfer, and involves the application of  physics, mathematics, chemistry, and increasingly, biology and com -puter science. Importantly, the field also emphasizes the process of  formulation, design, optimization, manufacture, and control of new sys -tems and devices.Technical developments in the last decade have established the  importance of interdisciplinary engineering and science, and as a result,  new technical disciplines within mechanical engineering have emerged.  These new areas build on an understanding of the fundamental behav -ior of physical systems; however, the focus of this work is at the inter -faces between traditional disciplines. Examples of the new disciplines include micro- and nano-mechanical systems, simulation and synthe -sis, integrated complex distributed systems, and biological engineering.Mechanical engineers can be found in many fields, including auto-motive, aerospace, materials processing and development, power pro -duction, consumer products, robotics and automation, semiconductor  processing, and instrumentation. Mechanical engineering can also be  the starting point for careers in bioengineering, environmental and aero -nautical engineering, finance, and business management.The Mechanical Engineering Option is accredited by the Engineering  Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050,  Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, (410) 347-7700. At the end of the first year, students who elect the Mechanical  Engineering Option are assigned advisers as close to their expressed  field of interest as possible, and together they develop programs of  study for the next three years. A student whose interests relate to mechanical engineering, but who  wishes to pursue a broader course of study than that allowed by the  requirements below, may elect the Engineering and Applied Science  Option.Attention is called to the fact that any student whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the required  courses listed below may be refused permission to continue work in  this option.Graduation Requirements 318ME Option Requirements 1.

The student™s transcript will include the phrase ﬁminor in  Neurobiologyﬂ. A Neurobiology minor is not available to majors in the  CNS or Biology options.NB Minor Requirements 1. Biology fundamentals. Bi 8 and Bi 92. Intermediate biology: Genetics: Bi 122; Development: Bi 117;  plus nine units of other 100-level Bi, NB, or Ch courses3. Introduction to neuroscience: NB/Bi/CNS 150 4.

PHILOSOPHY OPTION AND MINOR (PI)The philosophy option provides students with a broad education in  philosophy that is designed to complement the scientific curriculum at Caltech. Philosophy majors will be expected to learn about some of the  major figures and movements in the history of philosophy, and to learn  about contemporary philosophical debates. The philosophy option also aims to provide students with new perspectives on the material they  learn in their science courses, and to enable them to bring their techni -cal skills and scientific learning to traditional problems in philosophy.  Graduation Requirements 320The philosophy curriculum will help students to acquire the basic tools  of philosophical analysis: the ability to read and interpret philosophical  texts; the ability to identify strengths and weaknesses of philosophical  arguments; the ability to develop well-reasoned defenses of philosophi -cal positions; and the ability to anticipate objections to one™s own views.  In addition, the philosophy option will train students to express them -selves clearly and concisely in both writing and speaking. These critical  thinking and communication skills provide an excellent foundation for  any intellectual endeavor, and are critical to those pursuing careers in  fields such as law, business, medicine, and scientific research. The courses in the philosophy option concentrate in four major areas: philosophy of science; philosophy of mind, brain, and behavior;  history of philosophy; and ethics. In their coursework, students will  have the opportunity to discuss and debate philosophical issues in  small groups, and will learn how to offer and receive constructive  criticism. They will also receive detailed feedback on their persua -sive writing from several different members of the philosophy faculty.  In their senior thesis, philosophy majors will have the opportunity to pursue more intensive research in one particular area of philosophy,  and to sustain an argument on a larger scale, while working one-on- one with a member of the philosophy faculty. This will provide inter -ested students with a solid foundation for graduate work in philosophy and related fields.  Philosophy majors must take at least 99 units of philosophy courses during their four years as undergraduates. These must include 18 units  of Pl 90 ab, to be taken in any two consecutive terms in the senior year.  The 99 units may include nine units of freshman humanities in philoso -phy (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below), nine units of  Pl 98, and up to 18 units of study in related disciplines. Depending on their interests, philosophy majors may be required by the  option representative or their advisers to take up to 18 units in one or more  related areas. For example, students writing on political philosophy or phi -losophy of neuroscience will be expected to have the appropriate political  science or neuroscience background. Students whose primary interest  lies in the philosophy of scienceŠparticularly in the philosophy of specific  sciences such as physics or biologyŠwill have their intellectual interests  best served by taking classes in both the history and philosophy of sci-ence. Such students are encouraged to pursue the HPS option; or, if they  choose the philosophy option, they may be required to take some history  of science courses as part of their 99-unit requirement. Students considering the philosophy option will be well advised to take  a freshman humanities course in philosophy. From the sophomore year  onward, they should plan on taking one philosophy course per term, cul -minating in two terms of Pl 90 ab in the senior year. Students in Pl 90 ab  work with a faculty adviser to write a 10,000- to 12,000-word paper on a  topic of mutual interest. Senior theses are expected to be of a high stan -dard and to form the basis of students™ applications to graduate study in  philosophy, should they so desire. With the exception of Pl 98 and courses  taken during the first two quarters of the freshman year, all courses to be  counted toward the philosophy option must be taken for grades unless  special permission is granted by the option representative. 321PI Option Requirements 1. Pl 90 ab.2. 63 units of advanced philosophy courses, numbered 99 or  above. Up to nine units of freshman humanities in philosophy  (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below) and/or up  to nine units of Pl 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these advanced units.    3. 18 units of advanced philosophy courses numbered 99 or above,  or advanced non-philosophy courses that are closely related to  the student™s area(s) of philosophical interest. (Students wishing  to count non-philosophy courses toward their option require -ments must obtain prior approval from the philosophy option  representative or their adviser. Students will normally not be per -mitted to satisfy this requirement with core courses.)  4. 54 units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses in addition to the core. This requirement cannot be satisfied by  core or menu courses, or by courses listed as satisfying the  introductory laboratory requirement. Students are strongly  encouraged to choose their additional courses in areas that  complement their philosophy studies.5. Three units of oral communication. En 84 satisfies this require -ment, as do oral communication courses offered by other  options. 6. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  the courses listed above. Courses used to complete the philosophy option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another  option or minor. PI Minor Requirements The minor in philosophy is designed for students who want to pursue concentrated study in philosophy without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the philosophy option.  Philosophy minors must complete 72 units of philosophy courses.  Students wishing to do a minor in philosophy must declare a minor with  the philosophy option representative. Students completing the philos -ophy minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in philosophyﬂ  added to their transcripts. With the exception of Pl 98 and courses  taken during the first two semesters of freshman year, all courses to be  counted toward the philosophy option or minor must be taken for grades  unless special permission is granted by the option representative. 1. 72 units of philosophy courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of Pl 98 may be substituted for any nine units of the 72 required for the minor. 3. Nine units of freshman humanities in philosophy (courses  cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below) may be substituted  for any nine units of the 72 required for the minor. Courses used to complete the philosophy minor may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. Graduation Requirements 322PHYSICS OPTION (Ph)The physics option offers instruction in the fundamentals of modern  physics and provides a foundation for graduate study, which is gener -ally necessary for a career in basic research. The physics program also  forms an excellent basis for future work in a variety of applied fields.  An intensive version of the sophomore physics course (waves, quan -tum mechanics, and statistical mechanics) is offered for those planning  further study in physics and the required junior-level courses give a  thorough treatment of fundamental principles. Elective courses taken  during the junior and senior years allow students to explore their par -ticular interest. Some electives offer broad surveys, while others con -centrate on particular fields of current research. A choice of laboratory  course is offered at several levels. Students interested in concentrating  their studies in one specific area of physics should refer to the under -graduate physics website for course schedule recommendations.  Students are encouraged to become active participants in research  on campus, both during the summer and during the school year.  Academic credit for physics work done outside of the classroom can  be awarded in a variety of ways.  Students must maintain a grade-point average of 1.9 or better each year in the subjects listed under this division to remain in the physics  option.Ph \n",

HISTORY OPTION AND MINOR (H) Students who choose the history option will learn how to  do historyŠhow to think critically about past societies and their development, how  to read evidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With  the guidance of a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option  will explore the range of human experience in the realms of politics, cul -ture, religion, and economics, as well as science and technology. They  will learn both to challenge and revise existing historical narratives and  Undergraduate Information 301question their own ideas and assumptions about the past. Students will  develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources  to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback  on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students  with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical  skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to  understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside  of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work  will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers  in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a  wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent  preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or  public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history.  History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four  years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial  (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must  be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his -tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History  majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro -gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of  history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul -tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These  areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his -tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian  history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear -ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic  history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of  these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic -ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the  history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in  libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct  supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten -sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear  and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out  general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic  on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research  question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer  it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and  revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by  the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined  in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative.  These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history  proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci -ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language.  Graduation Requirements 302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech  will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history  (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore  year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also  a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or  continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social  sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con -centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a  history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of  concentration. H Option Requirements 1. H 99 abc.2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above.  Up to nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses  cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine  units of H 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these units.3. 63 of the total history units, including H 99 abc, must be in an area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the stu -dent™s adviser and the history option representative. 4. 36 of the total history units must be in an area or areas other  than the area of concentration, as defined in consultation with  the student™s adviser and the history option representative. H 99  abc may not be used to fulfill this requirement. 5. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed  as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by menu  courses.6. Three units of oral communication. En/Wr 84 satisfies this  requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other  options.7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  the courses listed above.Courses used to complete the history option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another  option or minor.  H Minor Requirements The history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen-trated study in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the history option.  History minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include  one directed reading course (H 98). All courses to be counted toward  the history minor must be taken for grades except for a freshman  humanities course in history when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students wishing to do a minor in history must declare  a minor with the history option representative. Students completing  the history minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in historyﬂ  added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross listed  Undergraduate Information 303Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for 3.  any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 725.  units required for the minor.   Students cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE  OPTION AND MINOR (HPS)The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the  opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil -osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between  science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi -mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins  and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since  antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi -cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours-es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun-dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems  in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience,  and physics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from  the faculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the  opportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis  work, and present their findings in a seminar setting. This option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of  how science is practiced and how that practice has changed over time.  Students learn to address questions such as: To what extent was the  scientific revolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and  how do scientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have  conceptions of scientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical  issues raised by experimentation with human or animal subjects? How has  relativity theory changed our conceptions of space and time? The option  is designed to complement the regular science curriculum at Caltech,  offering students the opportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the  strong technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. Because of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex  philosophical and historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in  writing and communication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS  option provides excellent preparation for students going into law, business,  medicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares stu -dents for graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science.HPS Option Requirements 1. Hum/H/HPS 18; HPS 102 ab; HPS/Pl 120; and HPS 103 (one quarter). (HPS 102 b fulfills the Institute science writing require -ment.)2. One advanced course in the history of science, chosen from  HPS/H offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; one  advanced course in philosophy of science, chosen from HPS/ Graduation Requirements 304Pl offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; and any four  courses in HPS. (No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be count -ed towards the HPS major.) 3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satis -fying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with  a number less than 10.4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.  Courses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. We recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option  take Hum/H/HPS 18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their  freshman humanities courses. Students making the decision to follow  this option in their sophomore year should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and  HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of Science, as early as possi -ble in that year. Students may also enter the option in their junior year  if they can complete the option™s requirements in time for graduation.  Please also note the following:Not all required courses are offered each term; students should  consult the current catalog to determine which terms required courses  are being offered, and should construct their course plan for the year  accordingly. We encourage students to choose their advanced social science  electives from among courses that will enlarge their perspective on  topics related to HPS (for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130,  PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125, PSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22).HPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two  consecutive terms in the Senior year. Students should coordinate with  their HPS adviser in determining their course schedule.HPS Typical Course Schedule First Year It is recommended that students intending to follow the HPS  option take  Hum/H/HPS 18 as one of their freshman humanities courses.

Students cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different  option or minor. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES (IDS) The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi -tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These  intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally  occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied  mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last  decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are  acquired with the objective of extracting actionable knowledgeŠin the  form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and pub -lic policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the  availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage,  and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans cannot deal  with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that  we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All  areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering,  manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of sce-narios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broadŠfrom sit -uations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those  in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which  computation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those  in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be  treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all  available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream.  As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and  electrical engineeringŠsignal processing, information and communica -tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo -rithmsŠbut also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The  result is an area that is new, fundamentally different that related areas  like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern  applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering.  The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and  signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of  data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary  nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses  where students will learn about how data touches science and engi -307neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu -dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry,  and beyond.  In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on  the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus  have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science. IDS Option Requirements 1.  Computer Science Fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 21 or Ma/CS 6c; and CS 38.2.  Mathematical Fundamentals.

Passing grades must be  earned in total of 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the  above requirements. IDS Double MajorsStudents interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second  option must fulfill all the requirements of the Information and Data  Sciences option. Courses may be used to simultaneously fulfill require -ments in both options. However, it is required that students have at  least 54 units of ﬂAdvanced Electivesﬂ and 18 units of ﬂApplications of Data Scienceﬂ that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a require -ment of the second option, i.e., the requirements of the Advanced  Electives and the Applications of Data Science sections must be fulfilled using courses that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling  a requirement of the second option. Any proposal to replace these  courses must be discussed with the option administrator. To enroll in  the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the  option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good aca -demic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for han-dling the heavier course load.IDS Typical Course Schedule Units per term1st2nd3rd Second Year CS 1Intro. to Computer Programming  9--CS 2Intro. to Programming Methods  -9-CS 38Algorithms --9Ma 2Differential Equations 9--Ma 3Intro. to Probability and  Statistics-9-Ma/CS 6 abIntro. to Discrete Methods 99-ACM/IDS 104Applied Linear Algebra9--HSS Electives999Scientific Fundamentals-99Other Electives--9Total 454536309Third Year SEC 10Technical Seminar Presentations -3-CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155Machine Learning & Data Mining -12-One of SEC 11-13Written Communication  --3Ma 108 aClassical Analysis9--EE/IDS 111Signal-Processing Systems and  Transforms 9--IDS/ACM/CS 157Statistical Inference --9ACM/EE/IDS 116Intro. to Probability Models 9--HSS Electives999Advanced Electives999Applications Electives-9-Other Electives--9Total 454239Fourth Year ACM/EE 106 aIntro.

INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM (ISP) The Interdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) is an undergraduate option  that allows the student to create their own scholastic requirements,  under faculty supervision, and to pursue positive educational goals that 311cannot be achieved in any of the other available options. A student™s  program may include regular Caltech courses, research courses, cours -es at other schools, and interdisciplinary study courses (item 5, next  page). In scope and depth, the program must be comparable to a nor -mal undergraduate program, but it need not include all of the specific  courses or groups of courses listed in the formulated Institute option  requirements for undergraduates.  The Curriculum Committee, a standing committee of the faculty, has  overall responsibility for the program. In addition, each student has  their own committee of at least two advisers, two of whom must be professorial faculty. Application material may be obtained at the dean  of undergraduate students™ office or website. ISP Administrative Procedures and Guidelines 1. An interested student must recruit at least two professorial faculty  members representing at least two different degree-granting options  to serve as the ISP faculty committee. Each member of the faculty  committee must provide a letter that includes:  a.  Faculty name and department/division, and the discipline    they ﬁrepresentﬂ within the proposed ISP.  b.  Faculty™s assessment of the student™s ISP proposal,     including the proposed degree title, as it relates to that     faculty™s discipline.  c.  Faculty assessment of whether the student could choose   an existing degree-granting option with some acceptable    accommodations, rather than create an ISP. That is, does    this ISP enable something that could not be accomplished   in a single option or major/minor combination.2.  Send the ISP proposal (cover sheet, proposed curriculum, and  the aforementioned letters from professorial faculty advisers to the  dean of undergraduate students for review and approval. 3.  The dean of undergraduate students sends the ISP petition to the  Curriculum Committee for review and final approval. This contract  includes the agreed-upon content of the student™s program and the  methods for ascertaining satisfactory progress for those parts of  the student™s program that are not standard Institute courses. This  contract may of course be amended, but any amendments must be  approved by the committee of two and the Curriculum Committee.  Copies of each student™s contract and of all amendments thereto,  along with all ISP records for each student and their transcript, are  kept in the permanent files of the Registrar™s Office. Passing grades  must be earned in a total of 486 units. 4.  The progress of each student in the ISP is monitored each quarter  by the registrar, and any deviations from the terms of the contract  are reported to the chair of the Curriculum Committee. Standards  for acceptable progress and for satisfactory completion of the  terms of the contract are the responsibility of the Curriculum  Committee. When the Committee is satisfied that the terms of the  contract have been fulfilled by the student, it recommends the stu -dent to the faculty for graduation.5.  A plan of study may include special ISP courses to accommodate  Graduation Requirements 312individual programs of study or special research that falls outside  ordinary course offerings. In order that credit be received for an ISP  course, a written course contract specifying the work to be accom-plished, time schedule for progress reports and completed work,  units of credit, and form of grading must be agreed upon by the  instructor, the student, and the committee of two, and submitted to  the registrar prior to initiating the work in the course. ISP courses  are recorded on the student™s transcript in the same manner as are  other Caltech courses.6. ISPs are intended for multiyear programs. Accordingly, the  Curriculum Committee urges students contemplating an ISP to  submit their petition during their second year and will not normally  consider such petitions any later than the first term of the student™s  third year. MATERIALS SCIENCE OPTION (MS) The aim of the Materials Science option is to prepare students for  research, professional practice, or advanced study in a rapidly advanc -ing interdisciplinary field, focusing on the relationships between the  properties of materials and their internal structure and how this struc -ture can be controlled. The program builds on the core curriculum to  develop analytical competence and use it for individualized research,  culminating in a one-year senior thesis. Materials Science students develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the  skills for continuing professional and intellectual growth. The first year  of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Science  degree is common for all students of the Institute, although freshman  elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of  engineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students  who elect the Materials Science option are assigned advisers appro -priate for their expressed field of interest. Together with their advisers,  they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the  Institute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities,  the Materials Science option requires one year of applied and compu -tational mathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a  wide variety of courses in science and engineering. An undergraduate  thesis is an essential part of the academic program. Any student in  the Materials Science option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to continue to work in the  Materials Science option.MS Option Requirements  1. Fulfillment of extended core requirements in Differential Equations  (Ma 2 or equivalent); Probability and Statistics (Ma 3, Ge/ ESE 118 or equivalent); Waves (Ph 2 a, Ph 12 a or equivalent),  Quantum Mechanics (Ph 2 b, Ph 12 b, Ch 21 a or equivalent);  Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Ph 2 c, Ph 12 c or  equivalent).  3132.

Math students go well beyond the basics to study the  structures of algebra, analysis and geometry, as well as the rudiments  of combinatorics and set theory. Students learn to write coherent and  complete proofs of various assertions, to work out non-trivial examples  and to use computational tools. The schedule of courses in the undergraduate mathematics option  is flexible. It enables students to adapt their programs to their needs  and mathematical interests and gives them the opportunity to become  familiar with creative mathematics early in their careers. Some students  go to use their background in mathematics as an entry to other fields,  such as physics, computer science, statistics, economics, business, finance, medicine and law. 315Freshmen considering majoring in mathematics should be aware  that the department strongly recommends taking the analytical  track of Ma 1 bc. Any student whose grade-point average is less than  1.9 at the end of the academic year, in the subjects under mathematics  and applied and computational mathematics may be refused permis -sion to continue work in the mathematics options. Ma Option Requirements 1. Ma 2.  2. Ma 3 or Ma 140 a.3. Ph 2 bc or Ph 12 bc4. Ma 5 abc, Ma 10, Ma 108 abc, Ma 109 abc. 5. Ma/CS 6 a or Ma 121 a.6. Ma/CS 6 c or Ma 116 a or Ma/CS 117 a.7. 45 additional units of Ma numbered 110 to 190 or ACM num -bered 95 or above. Courses in other options with high mathe -matical content may be used to fulfill this requirement with the  approval of the undergraduate option representative for mathe -matics. Of these 45 units, at most 18 can be from courses other  than Caltech Ma courses. 8. Math majors must take two quarters (18 units) of a single course, chosen from the Ma course listings with numbers between 110  and 190, inclusive. In years where one of these courses is given  as a one-term course only, it cannot be used to satisfy this  requirement.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING OPTION (ME)The objective of the undergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering  at Caltech is to produce graduates who will attain careers and higher  education that ultimately lead to leadership roles in academia, industry,  and government in areas of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technol -ogy related to fluid, solid, thermal, and mechanical systems. The program prepares students for graduate school and profes -sional practice and inspires them to undertake careers that provide an  opportunity to address the pressing technological needs of society.  Specifically, the program builds on Caltech™s core curriculum to com -bine individual depth of experience and competence in a particular chosen mechanical engineering specialty with a strong background in  the basic and engineering sciences. It maintains a balance between classroom lectures and laboratory and design experience, and empha -sizes the problem-formulation and solving skills that are essential to  any engineering discipline. The program also strives to develop in each  student self-reliance, creativity, leadership, professional ethics, and  the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. For  317interested students, there are opportunities to conduct research with a  faculty member. The outcome of the undergraduate program is to prepare the stu -dent to build on a fundamental education in physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology and to apply those principles to the solution of  open-ended engineering problems; to design, analyze, measure, and  evaluate fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems; to work effectively as  part of a team; to communicate effectively; to apply ethical consider -ations; and to understand the broader impacts of engineering develop -ments, including societal, cultural and environmental concerns. Mechanical engineering is the branch of engineering that is generally concerned with understanding forces and motion, and their application  to solving problems of interest to society. The field includes aspects of  thermodynamics, fluid and solid mechanics, mechanisms, materials, and energy conversion and transfer, and involves the application of  physics, mathematics, chemistry, and increasingly, biology and com -puter science. Importantly, the field also emphasizes the process of  formulation, design, optimization, manufacture, and control of new sys -tems and devices.Technical developments in the last decade have established the  importance of interdisciplinary engineering and science, and as a result,  new technical disciplines within mechanical engineering have emerged.  These new areas build on an understanding of the fundamental behav -ior of physical systems; however, the focus of this work is at the inter -faces between traditional disciplines. Examples of the new disciplines include micro- and nano-mechanical systems, simulation and synthe -sis, integrated complex distributed systems, and biological engineering.Mechanical engineers can be found in many fields, including auto-motive, aerospace, materials processing and development, power pro -duction, consumer products, robotics and automation, semiconductor  processing, and instrumentation. Mechanical engineering can also be  the starting point for careers in bioengineering, environmental and aero -nautical engineering, finance, and business management.The Mechanical Engineering Option is accredited by the Engineering  Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050,  Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, (410) 347-7700. At the end of the first year, students who elect the Mechanical  Engineering Option are assigned advisers as close to their expressed  field of interest as possible, and together they develop programs of  study for the next three years. A student whose interests relate to mechanical engineering, but who  wishes to pursue a broader course of study than that allowed by the  requirements below, may elect the Engineering and Applied Science  Option.Attention is called to the fact that any student whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the required  courses listed below may be refused permission to continue work in  this option.Graduation Requirements 318ME Option Requirements 1.

The student™s transcript will include the phrase ﬁminor in  Neurobiologyﬂ. A Neurobiology minor is not available to majors in the  CNS or Biology options.NB Minor Requirements 1. Biology fundamentals. Bi 8 and Bi 92. Intermediate biology: Genetics: Bi 122; Development: Bi 117;  plus nine units of other 100-level Bi, NB, or Ch courses3. Introduction to neuroscience: NB/Bi/CNS 150 4.

PHILOSOPHY OPTION AND MINOR (PI)The philosophy option provides students with a broad education in  philosophy that is designed to complement the scientific curriculum at Caltech. Philosophy majors will be expected to learn about some of the  major figures and movements in the history of philosophy, and to learn  about contemporary philosophical debates. The philosophy option also aims to provide students with new perspectives on the material they  learn in their science courses, and to enable them to bring their techni -cal skills and scientific learning to traditional problems in philosophy.  Graduation Requirements 320The philosophy curriculum will help students to acquire the basic tools  of philosophical analysis: the ability to read and interpret philosophical  texts; the ability to identify strengths and weaknesses of philosophical  arguments; the ability to develop well-reasoned defenses of philosophi -cal positions; and the ability to anticipate objections to one™s own views.  In addition, the philosophy option will train students to express them -selves clearly and concisely in both writing and speaking. These critical  thinking and communication skills provide an excellent foundation for  any intellectual endeavor, and are critical to those pursuing careers in  fields such as law, business, medicine, and scientific research. The courses in the philosophy option concentrate in four major areas: philosophy of science; philosophy of mind, brain, and behavior;  history of philosophy; and ethics. In their coursework, students will  have the opportunity to discuss and debate philosophical issues in  small groups, and will learn how to offer and receive constructive  criticism. They will also receive detailed feedback on their persua -sive writing from several different members of the philosophy faculty.  In their senior thesis, philosophy majors will have the opportunity to pursue more intensive research in one particular area of philosophy,  and to sustain an argument on a larger scale, while working one-on- one with a member of the philosophy faculty. This will provide inter -ested students with a solid foundation for graduate work in philosophy and related fields.  Philosophy majors must take at least 99 units of philosophy courses during their four years as undergraduates. These must include 18 units  of Pl 90 ab, to be taken in any two consecutive terms in the senior year.  The 99 units may include nine units of freshman humanities in philoso -phy (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below), nine units of  Pl 98, and up to 18 units of study in related disciplines. Depending on their interests, philosophy majors may be required by the  option representative or their advisers to take up to 18 units in one or more  related areas. For example, students writing on political philosophy or phi -losophy of neuroscience will be expected to have the appropriate political  science or neuroscience background. Students whose primary interest  lies in the philosophy of scienceŠparticularly in the philosophy of specific  sciences such as physics or biologyŠwill have their intellectual interests  best served by taking classes in both the history and philosophy of sci-ence. Such students are encouraged to pursue the HPS option; or, if they  choose the philosophy option, they may be required to take some history  of science courses as part of their 99-unit requirement. Students considering the philosophy option will be well advised to take  a freshman humanities course in philosophy. From the sophomore year  onward, they should plan on taking one philosophy course per term, cul -minating in two terms of Pl 90 ab in the senior year. Students in Pl 90 ab  work with a faculty adviser to write a 10,000- to 12,000-word paper on a  topic of mutual interest. Senior theses are expected to be of a high stan -dard and to form the basis of students™ applications to graduate study in  philosophy, should they so desire. With the exception of Pl 98 and courses  taken during the first two quarters of the freshman year, all courses to be  counted toward the philosophy option must be taken for grades unless  special permission is granted by the option representative. 321PI Option Requirements 1. Pl 90 ab.2. 63 units of advanced philosophy courses, numbered 99 or  above. Up to nine units of freshman humanities in philosophy  (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below) and/or up  to nine units of Pl 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these advanced units.    3. 18 units of advanced philosophy courses numbered 99 or above,  or advanced non-philosophy courses that are closely related to  the student™s area(s) of philosophical interest. (Students wishing  to count non-philosophy courses toward their option require -ments must obtain prior approval from the philosophy option  representative or their adviser. Students will normally not be per -mitted to satisfy this requirement with core courses.)  4. 54 units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses in addition to the core. This requirement cannot be satisfied by  core or menu courses, or by courses listed as satisfying the  introductory laboratory requirement. Students are strongly  encouraged to choose their additional courses in areas that  complement their philosophy studies.5. Three units of oral communication. En 84 satisfies this require -ment, as do oral communication courses offered by other  options. 6. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including  the courses listed above. Courses used to complete the philosophy option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another  option or minor. PI Minor Requirements The minor in philosophy is designed for students who want to pursue concentrated study in philosophy without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the philosophy option.  Philosophy minors must complete 72 units of philosophy courses.  Students wishing to do a minor in philosophy must declare a minor with  the philosophy option representative. Students completing the philos -ophy minor requirements will have the phrase ﬂminor in philosophyﬂ  added to their transcripts. With the exception of Pl 98 and courses  taken during the first two semesters of freshman year, all courses to be  counted toward the philosophy option or minor must be taken for grades  unless special permission is granted by the option representative. 1. 72 units of philosophy courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of Pl 98 may be substituted for any nine units of the 72 required for the minor. 3. Nine units of freshman humanities in philosophy (courses  cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below) may be substituted  for any nine units of the 72 required for the minor. Courses used to complete the philosophy minor may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. Graduation Requirements 322PHYSICS OPTION (Ph)The physics option offers instruction in the fundamentals of modern  physics and provides a foundation for graduate study, which is gener -ally necessary for a career in basic research. The physics program also  forms an excellent basis for future work in a variety of applied fields.  An intensive version of the sophomore physics course (waves, quan -tum mechanics, and statistical mechanics) is offered for those planning  further study in physics and the required junior-level courses give a  thorough treatment of fundamental principles. Elective courses taken  during the junior and senior years allow students to explore their par -ticular interest. Some electives offer broad surveys, while others con -centrate on particular fields of current research. A choice of laboratory  course is offered at several levels. Students interested in concentrating  their studies in one specific area of physics should refer to the under -graduate physics website for course schedule recommendations.  Students are encouraged to become active participants in research  on campus, both during the summer and during the school year.  Academic credit for physics work done outside of the classroom can  be awarded in a variety of ways.  Students must maintain a grade-point average of 1.9 or better each year in the subjects listed under this division to remain in the physics  option.Ph Option Requirements The first five requirements should be completed by the end of the  second year. In planning a program, note that Ph 6 and Ph 7 are each  offered only once per year, in the second and third terms, respectively.  The pass/fail option cannot be exercised for any courses used for these  requirements with the exception of courses that do not offer grades. 1.  Ph 3. 12.  Ma 2 and Ma 3.3.  Ph 12 abc.4.  Ph 6. 5.

Ph 70. 38.  Ph 106 abc.9.  Ph 125 ab.10. Ph 21 or Ph 22 or one term of Ph 121 abc or Ay 190.  1 Other laboratory courses may be substituted for the Ph 3 requirement, including Ph 5, Ph 8  bc, or APh 9 a.2 APh 23 is a prerequisite for APh/EE 24 and can be used towards the advanced physics elec -tive requirement. 3 Other communication courses e.g., Ay 30 (or Ay 141) and 31 or Ma 10 and 11 may be substi -tuted for Ph 70.Ph Required Electives 1. 90 units of Advanced Physics Electives, in addition to the above, 323include any of the following: any Ph, APh, or Ay, course num -bered 100 or above, or any of Ph 5, Ph 22, Ph 78, Ph 79, ACM  95, ACM 101, APh/EE 23, Ma 5, Ma 108, or up to 10 units for Ay 20 Œ 21.  Nine units towards the 90 unit requirement will be  given for taking three terms of Ph 77.  Students are encouraged  to take ACM 95 or the quarter of Ph 129 that covers analysis as part of this requirement. The pass/fail option cannot be exer -cised for any courses used for this requirement with the excep -tion of ACM 95 and courses that do not offer grades. Not more  than 36 units of Ph courses numbered 200 or above taken on a  pass/fail basis may apply toward this requirement. No more than  18 units of Ph 171-172 may apply toward this requirement with -out permission from the Undergraduate Option Representative.  Additionally, Ph 171-172 may only apply toward this requirement  if taken in increments of six units or more and a written summa -ry (2-4 pages in length) of the work completed is submitted to the Undergraduate Option Representative within 2 weeks of the  beginning of the subsequent quarter. Students may also petition  the Undergraduate Option Representative to request that cours -es from other options with suitable physics content apply toward  this requirement.  2. Nine units of science and engineering electives outside of Ph, Ay, APh, Ma, and ACM. These units are in addition to the  required Core science electives.  Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the  courses listed above.Ph Typical Course Schedule Units per term1st2nd3rd Second Year Ph 12 abc Waves, Quantum Physics, and  Statistical Mechanics999Ma 2, Ma 3Sophomore Mathematics 99-Ph 6, Ph 7Physics Laboratory -99ACM 95 abIntro.

The option emphasizes formal tools like  game theory, social choice theory, and formal political theory along with  quantitative methodologies to test those theories. In addition, the option  encourages original research. The design of the political science option  ensures that students will be well suited to pursue careers in government  or the private sector, as well as to pursue graduate work in political sci -ence, law, or public policy. Students who complete the political science  option can expect the following learning outcomes:  an understanding of and ability to use the theoretical tools of social  choice and game theory as applied to politics;an understanding and knowledge of how to apply quantitative  methods to study politics;the ability to present complex theoretical and quantitative material  in research reports and presentations; and the skills necessary to  pursue graduate education and careers in law, government, politics,  or public policy. Note: The official source on requirements for graduation is the Caltech cat -alog from the year in which a student began studies at Caltech.

Pass/fail grading cannot be elected for courses taken to satisfy option requirements. Courses taken as part of the computer  science minor are counted toward the total 486 units needed  for Institute graduation requirements. To enroll in the program,  the student should meet and discuss their plans with the option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good aca -demic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier course load.CONTROL AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS MINORControl and dynamical systems (CDS) may be pursued as a minor con -centration by undergraduates who are taking degrees in science, math -ematics, or engineering. The CDS minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech™s normal undergraduate degrees and is designed for stu -dents who wish to broaden their knowledge beyond their normal major  or who may wish to pursue a graduate program involving control or  dynamical systems. Students completing the minor requirements below  in CDS will have the phrase ﬂminor in control and dynamical systemsﬂ  added to their transcripts and their graduating degree materials. CDS Minor Requirements Complete CDS 110 or CDS 131 and CDS 231 or CDS 232Complete nine additional units in CDS courses, chosen from  CDS 110, CDS 112, CDS 131, CDS 141, CDS 232, CDS 233, CDS 242, CDS 243, CDS 244.Complete a three-term senior thesis approved by the CDS fac -ulty. All CDS courses to be applied to fulfill the CDS minor requirements  must be taken for grades, and students must obtain a grade of B or higher. The senior thesis requirement may be satisfied by completing  a three-term senior thesis in the student™s major option but on CDS  subject matter, with the approval of the thesis topic by the CDS option  representative, or by taking CDS 90 abc. Courses that are used to satisfy the CDS minor cannot be used to  satisfy course requirements in the major options, with the exception  that CDS 110 may be used in EAS options where this is part of their  requirements (e.g., ChE, EE, ME) and the senior thesis requirement may  be used to satisfy requirements for major options that require a senior  thesis. Courses taken as part of the CDS minor are counted toward the  total 486 units needed for Institute graduation requirements. A typical course sequence would be to take either CDS 110 or CDS 232 in the junior year, followed by the remaining courses and the senior  thesis in the senior year. Alternatively, it is possible to take all require -ments in the senior year. In addition to the requirements above, CS 1  and CS 2 are highly recommended. Graduation Requirements 280ECONOMICS OPTION (Ec)The economics option provides students with an understanding of the  basic principles underlying the functioning of economic institutions. It offers a modern quantitative approach seldom available at the under -graduate level. The emphasis on economic principles and modern  methodology provides students with an excellent preparation for gradu -ate study in economics, as well as for professional work in the fields of  business, law, economics, and government.  The option is sufficiently flexible so that students can combine  their pursuit of economics with studies in engineering, mathematics,  or science. The core of the option consists of an economic theory  component, a data analysis component, an applied microeconomic  component, and a macroeconomic/growth component. Students are  strongly encouraged t supplement this  core  with additional electives  in economics, political science, and mathematics.  Expected learning outcomes from completing the economics option  include: a proficiency in applying economic models to understand eco -nomic institutions; a proficiency in analyzing field and experimental data to prove  causal relationships between economic variables, to test eco -nomic theories, and to predict economic outcomes; an understanding of the causes of regional and global long-term  economic growth as well as the causes and consequences of  economic crises throughout history; an understanding of the role of market prices in allocating  resources and affecting the distribution of wealth; an appreciation of strategic behavior and asymmetric informa -tion in economic and social interactions; andan appreciation of the role of technological change and politics  in shaping economic policies. Note: The official source on requirements for graduation is the Caltech  catalog from the year in which a student began studies at Caltech.  Please see the catalog online, from this and previous years, for infor -mation regarding the applicable option requirements. Ec Option Requirements 1. Ec 11.2. Theory: Ec 121 ab and PS/Ec 172.3.

Graduation Requirements 282ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING OPTION (EE)The objective of the undergraduate program in Electrical Engineering at  Caltech is to produce graduates who will attain careers and higher edu -cation that ultimately lead to leadership roles in academia, industry, and  government in areas of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology  related to telecommunications, solid-state, robotics, information, com -puter and electrical systems.The program prepares its students for either graduate study, entre -preneurial careers, or research and development work in government  or industrial laboratories. It inspires them to undertake careers and pro -fessional practices that provide an opportunity to address the pressing  technological needs of society. It accomplishes this by building on the  core curriculum to provide a broad and rigorous exposure to the funda -mentals (e.g., math, science, and principles of engineering) of electrical  engineering. EE™s other program objectives are multiple. The program  strives to maintain a balance between classroom lectures and laboratory  and design experience, and it emphasizes the problem formulation, sys -tem-design, and solving skills that are essential to any engineering dis -cipline. The program is also intended to develop in each student self-re -liance, creativity, teamwork ability, professional ethics, communication  skills, and an appreciation of the importance of contemporary issues and  lifelong intellectual growth. For interested students, there are opportuni -ties to conduct research with a faculty member. Students electing this option normally choose to take the introductory  seminar EE 2 as a freshman-year elective. The formal study of electri -cal engineering begins in the sophomore year with courses such as,  Deterministic Analysis of Systems and Circuits, EE 44; Introduction to  Digital Logic and Embedded Systems EE/CS 10ab; semiconductor sen-sors and actuators, EE 40; the theory and laboratory practice of analog  circuits, EE 45; and then a course on feedback control systems, EE 113  or CDS 110. The junior year features the fundamentals of signals and  systems and digital signal processing, EE 111; random variables and  stochastic processes, ACM/EE/IDS 116; electromagnetic engineering,  EE 151; and an analog electronics laboratory, EE 90. In the senior year,  the student will be asked to demonstrate their ability to formulate and  carry out a design project through independent research or either a  senior thesis, EE 80 abc, or two courses selected from the senior project  design laboratory, EE 91 ab, and CS/EE/ME 75 c. In addition, the stu -dent throughout their studies and especially in the senior year, will have  a significant opportunity to take elective courses that will allow them to  explore earlier topics in depth, or to investigate topics that have not been  covered previously. (See the ﬁsuggested electivesﬂ section,  page 286.)A student whose interests lie in the electrical sciences but who wishes  to pursue a broader course of studies than that allowed by the require -ments of the electrical engineering option may elect the engineering and  applied science option.Attention is called to the fact that any student who has a grade-point  average less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects  listed under electrical engineering may be refused permission to continue  work in this option.Undergraduate Information 283EE Double MajorsThe electrical engineering option allows interested students to declare  electrical engineering as one of the majors in a double major pursuit. To  enroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans  with the option representative. In general, approval is contingent on  good academic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier course load. For students simultaneously pur-suing a degree in a second option, courses taken as required courses  for that option can also be counted as EE electives where appropriate.  However, courses that count toward the electives requirement in the  other option cannot be simultaneously counted toward satisfying the  elective requirement in EE. To qualify for an EE degree, the student  would need to complete all option requirements. EE '"
